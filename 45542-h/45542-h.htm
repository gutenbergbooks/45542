<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p>When the great history of this almost untellable
War comes to be told, historians will find themselves
faced with a collection of evidence so devious,
so at variance, that their task will be well-nigh
stupendous. Whether, when they come to sift
their data, they will have time to cast more than
a passing glance at the great military bases that
sprung up in an allied country, where once an invading
army had stood, remains to be seen. That
these bases, and in especial the largest and nearest
to the firing line, Boulogne, have played a large
r&ocirc;le in the scheme of things cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Yet, of all the many thousands who lived and
passed through Boulogne, there remains not one
who can tell of the gradual development of that
once insignificant fishing town into one of the
greatest bases in the War Zone.</p>

<p>Surely, therefore, it behoves those of us who
love every inch of her harassing cobblestones; to
whom her picturesque squalor is a thing of everlasting
joy; those of us who see in the sun-bathed
masts, half-hidden in grey mists, pictures whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Turneresqueness vies with Turner; who can clasp
fisherfolk, peasants and townsmen by the hand
and be proud to claim them friends&mdash;it behoves us
to recapture what can never be recaptured again,
because there is none left to tell the tale&mdash;a picture
of Anglicised Boulogne in war-time.</p>

<p>True, our Boulognese coast is not riddled with
fortifications like the approaches to an English
naval port, nor are our fields honeycombed with
trenches (though go past Calais, northward, towards
Dunkirk, and you shall see what you shall see!).
Yet there were days in 1914 when Boulogne
promised to play a larger r&ocirc;le in the history of
England than she had ever played before&mdash;days
when hospitals stood empty and all were prepared
to evacuate the town at a moment's notice, in
reply to the mayor's already printed mandates&mdash;days
when, had the enemy but known how
efficiently he had pierced the British lines, he
might have realised his dream of devastating our
island home and sweeping the coast with his
long-range guns from Calais to Boulogne.</p>

<p>Those days will never return. Between us at
the base and our enemies are a myriad valiant lives
and countless guns of every size and device, a
force, in fact, which no German strategy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
world, scrupulous or unscrupulous, can overcome;
and still the little temporary British city grows
and grows, a city of tents and red crosses and
corrugated iron huts; and still stalwart British
forms, marching along the winding white roads,
cast longing glances at the dim coast of distant
Albion.</p>

<p>But it is not for those who heard the call in the
later months so much as in memory of those early
heroes of Mons, who knew the bitterness of a
valiant retreat, the horror of forced marches along
parched roads, with only the prod of the next
man's bayonet to keep him awake, and only a flap
cut from the tail of his shirt between the pitiless
sun and the dreaded delirium that would leave him
a prey to the Huns' barbarities; in memory of
these it is that I take up the pen to run the gauntlet
of a thousand critical eyes on a way fraught
with difficulties.</p>

<p>My acknowledgments are due to Mr. A. M.
James for permission to use his photograph of
the cemetery, and to my brother Edgar, whose
patience in putting together what is of necessity
a piecy document has made the publication of this
diary possible.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p class="center mt2">By <span class="smcap">Major-Gen. Sir ALFRED TURNER, K.C.B.</span></p>


<p>In the following pages Miss Kate Finzi gives in
a plain, unvarnished style a terrible and graphic
picture of the horrors of war, which have been
intensified, as never before, owing to the ferocious
savagery of the German troops, as systematically
ordered by their officers and commanded by the
Kaiser himself, the greatest criminal in the world's
record; for this war, planned and prepared deliberately
by him, is the greatest crime ever committed
against civilisation and humanity. It is charitable
to designate him a criminal lunatic, or, as his
prototype Caligula was described, an epileptic,
with highly developed criminal instincts.</p>

<p>When one reads of such sufferings as those
described by Miss Finzi, one wonders for what end
Providence can have allowed such an inhuman
monster to exist and cause such sorrow, such
suffering, such death and destruction to be inflicted
on mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The books written upon the vast conflict are
already legion, but I think this is the first record&mdash;a
most pathetic and interesting record&mdash;of
what happened at the base hospitals at Boulogne,
where tens of thousands of wounded, maimed and
mutilated incessantly arrived, to be passed on to
England, or to linger there till death came as a
happy release from their sufferings.</p>

<p>How many officers and men of those glorious
"first seven divisions" which left these shores
in August, 1914&mdash;a tiny but, for its size, an
incomparable army, which stemmed the seemingly
irresistibly flowing tide of von Kluck's legions
against Paris&mdash;the "contemptible little army of
General French," as it was described by the
imperial braggart of Germany, lie buried near the
spot where stands the memorial pillar in honour
of Napoleon's army of invasion in 1804. After
the war it will be incumbent on us, with the
approval of our firm and faithful Allies, whose
spirit, bravery and skill in fighting has astounded
the world, to raise another monument especially
to the memory of our heroic countrymen who
withstood the hordes of the Hun and thwarted
his advance both on Paris and Calais.</p>

<p>Miss Finzi's book is quite unpretentious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
is a simple record of facts which brings home
vividly to our minds the sickening horrors of war
and the awful sufferings that our gallant defenders
have had to undergo in doing their duty, in the
service of their King and country, for the honour
and integrity of the Empire, and for the safety
and protection of the people in this country in
this great war of liberation. What they have
been protected from can well be gathered from
the openly expressed threats of the Germans&mdash;soldiers,
military writers, professors and ministers
of German religion&mdash;that the crimes and outrages
which they committed in Belgium and France,
Poland and Serbia, should be as nothing to those
which they would make our people suffer. It is
well that these things should be brought home to
our people, who, owing to our insular position,
have experienced nothing of the horrors of war
and are apt to make too light of them from want
of power to realise them.</p>

<p>Naturally there was great confusion at the
base, owing to the suddenness with which war
broke out upon nations entirely unprepared for
it and taken by surprise, for, although dark
suspicions of the evil designs of Germany lurked
in many men's minds, the extent of the infamy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the Kaiser and his pan-German parasites did
not enter into the minds of many people, not even
in the case of those who, like myself, thought they
knew Germans well. The latter veiled their innate
brutality, their blood lust, and their intention to
acquire world domination through brute force, with
consummate craftiness.</p>

<p>Miss Finzi gives a graphic account of the
troubles that had to be surmounted, owing to
insufficiency of hospital requisites, beds, medicines,
doctors and nurses; but this was inseparable from
the nature of things, and has long since been
righted. We may indeed be proud of our services
of mercy; nothing can exceed their value and
efficiency, namely the R.A.M.C and our nurses.
If our gallant soldiers and sailors engaged, through
political blunder, in the "Gallipoli gamble" and
Kut disaster had been as well tended and supplied
as those in France, how many lives, thrown away
through political ineptitude, would now have been
spared to us!</p>

<p>Miss Finzi writes most modestly of her own
work, but we know that she and all the genuine
nurses and helpers worked devotedly and well, and
that the deepest debt of gratitude is due from the
nation to them, who softened the horrors of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to our soldiers, who ministered aid to them when
they were sore stricken by wounds or diseases, and
mitigated their tortures. It must not be forgotten
that for many months the capture of Calais seemed
not improbable; the Huns had no doubts upon
the subject, and time after time, as in the case of
Paris and Verdun, the bloodthirsty Kaiser gave his
vain and arrogant orders: "<cite>To be taken at all
cost, no matter at what sacrifice!</cite>" A truly
beneficent ruler and father of his people! The
R.A.M.C. and nurses, therefore, were working
at terrible disadvantage, with no certainty that
the bestial and brutish enemy would not shortly
appear, to wreak upon them his savage instincts
of murder and lust, signs of which were constantly
brought in to them: terrible wounds caused by
expanding bullets, and, worst of all, accounts by
eye-witnesses and victims of the perpetual and
designed firing upon hospitals, dressing stations,
stretcher-bearers, it being, apparently, a craze of
the Germans to kill and ill-treat what is helpless
and cannot resist them. Tales also were related
of civil population&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;being
butchered, and Red Cross nurses outraged
in the most fiendish manner, and then mutilated
and murdered. With such possible prospects and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
fate at the hands of men compared to whom the
Huns of Attila, the Goths of Alaric, the Tartars
of Timur and the Mongols of Genghis Khan
deserved a crown of mercy. Imagine what our
nurses are and what blessings they have brought
to our soldiers and sailors. At the commencement
of the Crimean War there were no Army nurses
and no civil nurses, except those dreadful creatures
described by Charles Dickens in "Martin Chuzzlewit,"
such as Sairey Gamp and Betsy Prig&mdash;fat,
waddling, coarse, ignorant, unclean and unkempt,
and usually smelling of gin; they attended births,
sick-beds, and laying out of corpses, in which they
took great pride, as it brought them in touch with
the undertaker, to their mutual advantage. Contrast
such so-called nurses, in their poke bonnets,
smelly robes and clogs, with their huge, bulging
umbrellas, their noisiness and heavy hands, with
those of to-day, with their neat and serviceable
uniform, their gentleness, their light hands, their
kindness and sympathy with their suffering
patients. As the late Dean Hole wrote in his
"Now and Then," they might be compared to a
beautiful yacht scudding along in a light breeze,
under a blue sky and shining sun, while the
ancient apologies for nurses rolled along, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
water-(or gin and water) logged barge in the Thames in
a thick, yellow November fog. (Dean Hole.)</p>

<p>It was to Florence Nightingale, of ever-blessed
memory, that we owe the foundation of our Army
nursing system in 1854. When the news of the
battle of the Alma came, and of many thousands of
wounded men with no nurses and a totally insufficient
medical staff, <em>and not a single ambulance</em>,
she volunteered to take out a number of nurses.
For a wonder her offer was accepted, for in those
days every sort of change in Army matters was
considered a pernicious innovation. She took out
thirty-four nurses to the Crimea, and before long
had 10,000 wounded in her charge. The work
which she and her nurses did was marvellous, and
they stuck to it till their health broke down, as
our present nurses have done. After the war
&pound;50,000 was subscribed for the purpose of founding
an institution for the training of nurses in
connection with St. Thomas's and King's College
Hospitals. From that time the Army nursing
system has steadily developed under the practical
and ever-ready patronage of Royalty, till it reached
its present perfection. In the Soudan and South
African Wars the services of the nurses were invaluable.
When the present war showed itself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
be one of such gigantic dimensions, and when our
Army, due to the genius of Lord Kitchener,
swelled to the size of millions, it was feared that a
sufficient number of Army nurses could not be
forthcoming; but then the women of England
showed what they were made of. Hundreds and
thousands devoted themselves at once to training
as nurses, others to the less-skilled work required in
hospitals for the victims of war; and now, owing
to them and the admirable chiefs and subordinate
officers of the R.A.M.C, and to the patriotic and
self-sacrificing manner in which private medical
practitioners have come forward with their services,
little or nothing is wanted, considering the gigantic
nature and scope of this terrible war.</p>

<p>Miss Finzi is to be congratulated upon having
written a most interesting and readable book, full
of facts and personal experiences, such experiences
as, please God, no one will again have to relate;
and this will be so when once the Hohenzollerns,
the cause of all trouble in Europe and elsewhere for
many decades, are exterminated or driven into
obscurity.</p>

<p>The work shows forth in bright colours the
universal devotion of our nurses&mdash;heroic women
who face all dangers and hardships for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
doing good to others. Among these must ever
stand forth the name of Edith Cavell, who spent
her whole life in mitigating the sufferings of others,
who nursed even German officers in her hospital
who had probably committed unspeakable crimes
and atrocities in Belgium. This weighed as
nothing, as might have been expected, in the eyes
of the barbarous Teutons, to whom mercy, justice
and gratitude are unknown. She was done to
death vilely and brutally, but her martyrdom will
never be forgotten or forgiven; it will be one of
the foulest of the many foul stains on the fame of
the Kaiser and his accomplices, while it will ever
shed a ray of glory upon the noble record of our
British Nurses.</p>

<small>October, 1914</small></h2>


<p><i>October 21st, London.</i> It was not without a
sense of relief that we watched the hands of the
station clock move on to the stroke of six, heard
the train doors slam, and cast a last look at the
anxious little group of friends who clustered
round the carriage doors to bid us farewell and
God-speed.</p>

<p>To be quite frank, their cheering savoured
somewhat of mourning and much of admonition.</p>

<p>Were we not the tattered remnants of a once-flourishing
Red Cross detachment, whose energies
and equipment alike had been left behind at the
enforced evacuation of Ostend? Were we not
about to face all kinds of undreamed-of perils?</p>

<p>So they whispered to us; but as we relapsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
into our seats, to the accompaniment of a cheery
chorus of rag-times from the extensive r&eacute;pertoire
of the recruits in a neighbouring carriage, our
hearts beat hard with trepidation and anticipation
of the Great Unknown. After all, who were we
amongst the countless thousands clamouring to
"get out" to the scene of action?</p>

<p>Merely two Englishwomen, of none too much
experience and no too great age, whom it might
please Fate to carry into the scene of action, there
to play the smallest of parts and to be vouchsafed
an insight into the vagaries of war.</p>


<p><i>Southampton.</i> It was a clear, still, moonlight
night when we reached Southampton, the docks
silent and darkened. Outside many ambulance
wagons awaited their turn to be loaded. The
hotel to which we had been recommended had
been commandeered as an embarkation office.
Moreover, Mr. N&mdash;&mdash;, the clergyman who was
to have met us and finished the journey with
us, failed to turn up. So, after passport formalities,
we went straight on board.</p>

<p>All we carried by way of luggage was one
small hand-valise apiece, containing, besides
changes of underwear, the regulation Red Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
caps, aprons, dresses&mdash;that uniform so effective
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>, so unbecoming to the individual.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 22nd, s.s. &mdash;&mdash;, 8 a.m.</i> The cabins
were nearly all taken for the officers of the Irish
regiment crossing on the boat, so we passed a
more or less restless night in the saloon. As the
stewardess said: "We like to give the men the
best of everything. Who knows when they will
next sleep in a bed?" It makes one choke to see
these fine strapping fellows going out so cheerfully
to meet their fate. It is only then that one ceases
to think of war as a great game, and sees it as a
great slaughter!</p>

<p>When we set sail the mysterious blue, herald
of dawn, was over all, but we are entering Havre
harbour in a sea that is black and dreary and full
of forebodings.</p>


<p><i>Le H&acirc;vre.</i> The post office here might be in
Finsbury, the cablegram window in Leadenhall
Street, for Havre is full of British Tommies in
their smart new khaki and gilt numerals and
badges, and they walk up and down the streets
in twos and threes&mdash;very much at home, or
separately&mdash;equally lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>When we landed at Havre the Rev. E&mdash;&mdash;
N&mdash;&mdash;, our khaki-clad parson, joined us; and,
having deposited our luggage at the station and
lunched, we wended our way to the British Consulate,
and British and French Red Cross offices,
in the hope of gleaning some news of the rest of
our party, who seemed to have vanished off the
face of the globe.</p>

<p>Our Red Cross uniform carries with it a
strange mixture of respect and suspicion&mdash;respect
for the noble symbol we bear, suspicion on account
of the many unlicensed people of somewhat doubtful
repute who have flooded the country since the
outbreak of war, perpetrating many indiscretions,
opening many uncalled-for charities&mdash;all under the
name of the Red Cross, with which, ten chances
to one, they have no connection at all.</p>

<p>To us, however, everybody is so kind and
courteous, and our parson, being a tall, white-haired
man of military bearing, and in appearance
much more like a general than a sky-pilot, commands
universal respect and salutes.</p>

<p>We decided to spend a night at Havre and
call early for news at the Consulate, and it was
then that my modicum of French and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savoir-faire</i>
in the ways of hotels and hotel proprietors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
stood us in good stead, for the rest of the party
knew no word of French and appeared never before
to have travelled abroad.</p>

<p>At the Consulate we came across Lady &mdash;&mdash;,
one of the women we were seeking and who was
supposed to be seeking us. As we entered the
room a familiar voice rang out: "In the name of
the Belgian Government you can do anything"&mdash;and
we found ourselves face to face with the chic
little woman who, charming though she may be
at a London "at-home," is, we fear, liable to
give our Allies a false impression of English
women in war-time.</p>

<p>She has already courted notoriety quite successfully
in Belgium, where she would appear at the
most busy moment in the wards with a smile and
a "<em>May</em> I see round your hospital?" only to be
followed by her press-man with a camera. Seeing
she has never, to our knowledge, done a day's
work in the wards, we are growing tired of
her portraits in the daily papers and weekly
journals:</p>

<p>"Lady &mdash;&mdash; rendering valuable aid to a
severely wounded Belgian," or:</p>

<p>"A war heroine who is giving her services at
the front."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>We retired early, but the incessant sounds of
coming and going made sleep impossible to me.
As the moon peeped through the open window
on to the restless form of my companion, I crept
out of bed and knelt by the embrasure. She
looked very young with her halo of fair hair, and
for the first time I realised how utterly alone we
were. It is odd how quickly people come into
one's life nowadays, become the most important
factor of existence, and, meteor-like, pass out of
one's ken, leaving nothing but a fast-dimming
memory to prove how large they once loomed
on the horizon. After all&mdash;war or no war&mdash;we
are absolute strangers, of different interests,
different education, different social standing. Yet
for weal or woe our lot is cast together. Only for
a moment these thoughts assailed me; then the
bigness of the Great Game in which we are to
play our parts drove all little personal feelings
away.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 24th, Rouen.</i> We arrived yesterday
in the wild-goose chase after the Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; who
wired for us and was to have given us employment,
and are installed at a little hotel perched on
the top of the hill, from the windows of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
we can enjoy the old garden, gorgeous in its
autumn tints of brown, gold and green.</p>

<p>There being an over-sufficient number of well-equipped
hospitals here, as in Havre, we have not
bothered to inquire after work, but the Rev. E&mdash;&mdash;
N&mdash;&mdash; has gone on to Paris, and so we spent the
day enjoying the sights of Rouen. Of the beauties
of the Gothic Cathedral of St. Ouen, of the smartness
of our Tommies, of the less solid but strikingly
lithe and businesslike-looking French soldiers, in
their historic and treasured red trousers and blue
coats, there is much to be said. Yet it is the
incongruity of the cosmopolitan crowd that is
most noteworthy.</p>

<p>Dusky Zouaves, in wide pantaloons and
brilliant coatees, are to be seen on all sides&mdash;mostly
with bandaged limbs, be it noted&mdash;and
alongside swarthy Indian Mussulmans, clad in
khaki and topped with turbans. Side by side with
them go interpreters in mufti, Scottish soldiers in
tartans and covered kilts. Little French girls
walk past with R.A.M.C. badges and numerals
pinned across their shawls; Army nurses, in grey
and red; the usual crowd of dark Frenchwomen
in their sombre weeds.</p>

<p>Watching the seething mass of humanity on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the quay, the marching soldiers, the footsore,
homeless refugees, the motley crowd culled from
every conceivable race and every quarter of the
globe, it seems as if the Powers Above had decided
to abolish the distinction between east and west,
black and white, and weld together one race to
combat the oncoming Germans. For surely we
are pitted against a foe so strong in physique,
and so brave and cunning, that many years of
strenuous training and thrift will be required to
fit the united races to withstand his onslaught.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 25th.</i> Mr. N&mdash;&mdash; returned last night
from Paris armed with introductions to Lord
---- at Boulogne headquarters, where we are to
go, and the information that the Paris hospitals
are being steadily cleared.</p>

<p>All this time we have had very little news.
Since the fall of Antwerp on October 9th, and the
beginning of the Ypres-Armenti&egrave;res battle two
days later, we have had nothing but rumours to
subsist on, and these alternately wildly optimistic
and disquieting.</p>

<p>It seems so strange to think, while wandering
through the churches here, glorying in the leisure
to enjoy the exquisite contour of the Gothic arches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the rich medi&aelig;val windows, the Renaissance
chapels, that to those enemies, who are proving
themselves such utter Vandals, we really owe so
much of our knowledge of Art and Architecture.
Can any cultured being who has at some time or
another associated with his art-loving foe, studied
his literature, perused Burckhardt, delved into the
depths of Faust's philosophy and the heights of
Zarathustra's madness; sat on Brunhilde's rock
or felt the Valkyrie riding past in the furious sweep
of the snowstorm; gazed from the heights of the
Black Forest into the unknown stretch of sky
beyond the blue hills with that yearning for
beautiful things engendered by a land endowed
by Nature with every gift; and, descending into
the darkening forests, realised the milieu which
inspired Grimm's "Fairy Tales" and Morgenstern,
and even the translators of Ibsen and
Jacobsen&mdash;can such a being fail to be nonplussed
at this huge upheaval?</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 26th, Train militaire.</i> We are passing
through the lovely Norman country at a snail's
pace in a military train bearing French soldiers to
the front. Their distant "Marseillaise" sounds
less hearty than our Tommies' "It's a long way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
to Tipperary," but then they already know the
devastation War has wrought in their homes; they
are the defenders of an invaded country.</p>

<p>The cost of our ticket to Abancour (military
rate, for our uniform amongst the French receives
the utmost consideration) is 1 franc 50 centimes.
After Abancour, it appears, there are no trains to
Boulogne, so how we are to get across the sixty
intervening miles no man knows!</p>


<p><i>Abancour, 7.30 p.m.</i> We reached the neat
little model village of Abancour at dusk. It stands
on a wind-swept plain, over which the lowering
clouds are scurrying menacingly this evening.
Just as at Havre market women offered us flowers
"for the blessed Croix Rouge," so here the proprietor
of the post-card shop insists on giving us
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pastilles de menthe</i> to take on our journey.</p>

<p><i>Eu.</i> This is the nearest point we can get to
Boulogne, and having knocked up the sleepy
hotel-keeper at 10 p.m. to obtain a night's lodging,
having made bovril for us all out of the tablets
some good friend had thrust into my travelling kit,
and served out rations of horse-flesh sandwiches and
nuts to make them savoury, I have at last tumbled
into my damp bed, wrapped in a travelling rug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>A dismal rain has set in, which brings to mind
the words of the secretary at the Rouen Consulate:
"When winter sets in the fighting must temporarily
cease. I know every inch of Belgium; know,
too, that no attack can be made on country so
sodden that every wheel sinks at least a yard into
the ground. Believe me, what the Germans have
they will hold&mdash;at least this winter. For Belgium
will be impregnable!"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 27th.</i> We arose at 5 a.m. to catch a
train bound towards Abbeville, and, after a refreshing
draught of black coffee in glasses, found
ourselves installed in the train, with the prospect
of staying there till 5 p.m. If we had wondered at
finding Eu well guarded on all sides, we no longer
did so when we learned that only a few weeks back
it was in enemy hands, and formed, in fact, the
German headquarters on the march on Paris.</p>

<p>Shortly before reaching Abbeville a young
Belgian soldier in the carriage next door put his
head in to inquire politely whether we were some
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">infirmi&egrave;res anglaises</i> who had tended the
Belgian wounded in Ostend.</p>

<p>It appeared he recognised Miss A&mdash;&mdash;, as soon
as she doffed her ugly felt uniform hat, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nurse who had dressed his wounded back the day
he was carried into the Casino hospital after the
Battle of Termonde.</p>

<p>His career, which he sketched delightedly for
our edification, perched on the arm of the window
seat, had been eventful, to say the least of it.</p>

<p>Aged 17, Fernand L&mdash;&mdash;, of Brussels, together
with fifteen others of his school class of twenty,
joined the ranks as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">volontaires</i> and served through
Namur. Captured by the Germans in a farmhouse
where he was scouting, he contrived to
escape and reach his native town, where the now
famous burgomaster, the valiant M. Max, got
his papers <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis&eacute;d</i>. By asserting that he was only
fifteen years old, and therefore not liable to
military service, he finally reached Cherbourg,
and is now on his way back to the front, hoping
to join some regiment at Calais.</p>

<p>A charming boy, full of enthusiasm for the war
and the conviction that we shall soon be marching
into Berlin, his one regret, when he heard how the
hospital equipment had had to be abandoned to the
enemy, was that he had not helped himself to a
much-needed blanket.</p>

<p>"Had I but known," he exclaimed, "I would
have taken four!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Fernand L&mdash;&mdash; was clad in a wonderful combination
of garments that he seemed to have
gleaned on his journeyings; most remarkable
amongst them were the green knitted socks and
pair of canvas shoes which some Good Samaritan
had given him at Ostend, in those days when even
the supply of an&aelig;sthetics was apt to run low.
Proudest of all was he of the fact that he had once
spent a few days in Liverpool to play in a football
match, which fact, he felt, bound him to his allies
more than any of the forced ties of war. His companion,
a few years his senior, who spoke seven
languages, was a good-looking youth with a radiant
smile. They had been together through various
escapades, and were full of the atrocities of the
Germans, which, alas! seem authentic enough.</p>

<p>Once when they were fleeing they had come to
a deserted village where a farmer gave them shelter.
His only daughter had been brutally mutilated and
murdered before her own parents because, in resisting
the embraces of an officer, she scratched
out one of his eyes.</p>

<p>"They cut off her breasts and carried away a
foot as a trophy," was the tale they told.</p>

<p>As they got out, the Belgians, in token of
gratitude, pressed into our hands the little paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
flags of the Allies that they were wearing and
buttons from their coats. Then, seizing a notebook
from my pocket, Fernand L&mdash;&mdash; inscribed
their names and addresses at Bruges, exacting at
the same time promises that we would call and see
them, or their families, on our way "to the Rhine
in a few months"!</p>

<p>The well-guarded lines, the ammunition trains,
the big guns and horses and other paraphernalia
of war&mdash;how real it all begins to seem!</p>

<p>At Abbeville, where we explored the shops and
camps and churches, a nasty rumour came through,
via two cavalry officers, that the Germans are at
Calais, and many of the townsfolk appeared at
their doors to bewail their fate.</p>

<p>On leaving every place of beauty one wonders
how long it will remain safe from the Vandals&mdash;one
leaves it with a sentimental longing to linger
for "one last look."</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 27th, Boulogne.</i> The sky was a lurid
red as our train steamed into Boulogne, and an
evening mist hung over the town. On all sides
high masts rose into the sky; hospital ships, ambulance
trains, little fishing-smacks, one does not
know to which to give most attention. Everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a><br />
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a><br />
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the population of picturesque fisherfolk in
their brown blouses gives way admiringly to the
Red Cross ambulances and officials who carry on
their work on such an enormous scale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i043">
<img src="images/i043.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt="HOSPITAL SHIP" />
<span class="caption">HOSPITAL SHIP</span>
</a></div>

<p>The journey had seemed long enough in spite
of its many incidents, as day by day we watched
the pretty though uninteresting fields slip by, or
restlessly paced the stations during the interminable
halts, with little food for thought, save vague
surmises as to the future, and little to eat save the
slightly bitter bread of the people and apples, the
only things obtainable at wayside stations already
ransacked by the hordes of hungry soldiers who had
passed through earlier; and oftentimes we had been
glad enough to descend from the carriages to refresh
ourselves at the station pumps, marked
"drinkable" or "non-drinkable," as the case
might be.</p>

<p>We had formed an odd trio. The tall, bent
figure of the clergyman, with his dreamy demeanour
and utter obliviousness of all things practical;
my commandant, a young woman who,
having spent most of her life at hospital work,
hailed every diversion from the same gleefully.
Everything to her was new, for she had never been
out of England before, and to a veteran traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
her joy at the ways of this new country was extraordinarily
interesting. Thirdly, there was myself,
fresh from the salutary discipline of the wards
of a London hospital.</p>

<p>And now it is all over, that journey. The
destination is reached. The Unknown will soon be
revealed.</p>

<p>The Commissioner to whom we were directed
received us with open arms.</p>

<p>"Nurses&mdash;thank God!" was the exclamation
as we were turned over to the mercies of the billeting
officer, who designated an airy room overlooking
the quayside, on the third floor of the Red
Cross headquarters, for our use.</p>

<p>Yet it appears that in spite of the dearth of
nurses there are many formalities to be gone
through before we can begin work; and as only
nurses who have had three years' training in a big
London hospital are to be accepted (for is anything
but the <em>best</em> good enough for our fighting men?),
there may be some difficulty for probationers.</p>

<p>Thus, having deposited our bundles in our
billets, we were sent to see Lady &mdash;&mdash; at the hotel,
where she combines the duties of lady-in-waiting
to Queen Am&eacute;lie of Portugal and organiser-in-chief
of the Red Cross nurses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we learned for the first time of the
confusion that arises out of the fact that both
qualified nurses and members of the Voluntary Aid
Detachment are wearing the same uniform; we
heard, too, of the difficulties experienced by the
authorities to prevent unlicensed people organising
hospitals which they are unfitted to run.</p>

<p>As we wended our way back wearily through
the lighted, crowded streets teeming with life
(Miss A&mdash;&mdash; having signed a year's contract as
a trained nurse), something told me that this is
to be the scene of my activities too; that so long
as my betrothed is in France, Providence will let
me play my part.</p>

<p>On returning to headquarters we learned for
the first time the unpleasant function of the
Censor. All letters have to be left open, posted
in the military box, and, if they are to pass the
Censor, must contain no mention or description
of places, troops, ships, people we have met on
our journey, etc.</p>

<p>This is not merely a precaution against spies,
we are told, but a measure of prudence in regard
to false rumours; for men who have never got
farther than Boulogne, and never been within gunshot,
have been known to write home long tirades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
about the bloody trenches in which they stand
all day, dodging fragments of shells and killing
Germans by the score!</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 28th.</i> After breakfast this morning
we set out to see whether there were any letters
from home at the Consulate. On our way up the
hill a funeral overtook us. There were four hearses
and seven coffins, each covered with a Union Jack,
which contrasted strangely with the weird-shaped
French funeral carriages and the drivers in costumes
like beadles with large three-cornered hats.</p>

<p>We followed the cort&egrave;ge a quarter of an hour
up the hill to the cemetery, where the newly
consecrated ground was full of freshly covered
graves.</p>

<p>The coffins were soon lowered, and as they lay
there in a row not an eye of the little group of
onlookers was dry.</p>

<p>The R.A.M.C. pall-bearers, the chaplain who
went through the service with a rapidity that
showed his familiarity with the job, a handful of
French peasants&mdash;that was all. And they laid
them to rest at the top of the hill, and only two
English nurses who never saw them could bear
the message of their last resting-place to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
homes. God! that such wanton destruction
should be.</p>

<p>Opposite our window, as I write, the ambulance
men are deftly unloading a train and carrying their
sad, still burdens aboard the hospital ship on which
Miss A&mdash;&mdash; crossed from Ostend. All day long,
all night long, the wagons come and go. Funerals
pass, not one, but three, four, five at a time, followed
by orderlies; turbaned Sikhs and Gurkhas,
looking quaintly odd with their unaccustomed
shirts (gifts, no doubt, from some willing helpers
at home) hanging loose below their coats, like a
flounced skirt, and creating a perfect sensation
whenever they pass the simple peasant folk.</p>

<p>Later, we walked into Wimereux and took
snapshots of the wounded Tommies who thronged
the beach. They were mostly arm and leg cases,
and a cheery, if rough-looking, lot too, in their
bedraggled khaki, which, from the distance, was
scarcely distinguishable from the sands.</p>

<p>The Reverend E&mdash;&mdash; N&mdash;&mdash; has found plenty
to do, and is already taking work out of the overtaxed
Bishop's hands. I, in the meantime, am
making the best of my leisure and enjoying every
hour of the sunshine. "Father N.," as we call
the padre, got into conversation with an Army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
veteran to-day at lunch, whose views were interesting.</p>

<p>"Do you think the Germans will get to
Calais?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Probably not; but if they do, they'll make
for here. This is the place they're after&mdash;as a post
for their submarines. And Heaven knows what
we shall do with our stores. It won't be possible
to get them away in time!"</p>

<p>About a mile along the quay we came upon
the debris of a camp with the fire still burning;
piles of reaping machines, traction engines and
carts, all bearing the names of English firms from
Manchester to Crouch End, lay alongside; and,
finally, in the distance there hove in sight the
French refugee ship which was blown up in the
Channel yesterday between here and Folkestone.</p>

<p>In the evening we joined a group of nurses
round the fire. They are pleasant girls just down
from Paris, where they did relieving work at some
of the hotel hospitals.</p>

<p>The Astoria in particular they describe as a
maze. "You go to get a drink of milk for a
patient, and when you've found the milk you've
lost your man and may hunt for hours, only to
find in the end that his need has already been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
supplied," they say. Their assistants were culled
from the French nobility, whose unflagging efforts
to help are typical of France's indomitable spirit.
Amusing incidents often occur.</p>

<p>One doctor, on being much pressed, accepted
an invitation to tea with a well-known aristocratic
family, who assured him they were inviting people
who would be of <em>especial</em> interest to him. His
amusement on arriving may be pictured when he
found that the other guests consisted of a roomful
of wounded Tommies.</p>

<p>Another doctor, overwhelmed by the amount of
titles to whom he had been introduced, meeting a
nurse in the corridor, began wearily with:</p>

<p>"Look here, I say, now, are <em>you</em> a blooming
princess?" before he gave his orders!</p>

<p>In spite of the wonderful dirt and bad drainage
that reigns in the nurses' quarters, we must be
grateful, they say, for our accommodation. Nurses
aren't expected to require much, it seems. Someone
quoted the old chestnut from <cite>Punch</cite> of the
lady who, on being asked by the newly arrived
nurse in which room she was to sleep, exclaimed
in blank amazement:</p>

<p>"Oh, but I thought you were a trained hospital
nurse!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 29th.</i> Let me tell the tale of No. &mdash;&mdash;
Stationary Hospital. It should go down to posterity
as a memorial of what British resourcefulness
may achieve, even if its existence was the
outcome of the proverbial British state of unpreparedness.
For what in the annals of History has
equalled the holocaust and chaos of modern warfare,
of which there was no precedent, of which
everything has had to be learned by the bitterest
experience?</p>

<p>Three days before we left England, at the beginning
of the fight for Calais, which continues to
grow more violent daily, a certain Major N&mdash;&mdash;
found himself in charge of the wounded who were
being brought down by the thousand in trains, and
left helpless on their stretchers by the quayside to
await the arrival of the ever-busy hospital ships.</p>

<p>Already the C&mdash;&mdash; and I&mdash;&mdash; Hotels were
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">choc-&agrave;-bloc</i> with wounded, who lay so close together
in the corridors that it was necessary to
climb over one stretcher to reach the next patient,
and often stand astride the pallets to dress the
wounds.</p>

<p>The Casino was opened, but in less time than
it takes to tell was as crowded as the others.</p>

<p>A disused sugar shed, a vast wooden barn whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cracked cement floor is piled high with dust, whose
smashed glass roofing is besmirched with dirt, is
hardly an ideal site for a hospital, but it is the best
thing to hand, and the Major commandeered it,
and here, before the lumber had been cleared,
before the glass had been repaired or the walls
whitewashed, the wounded began to tumble in.
It wasn't much of a place, but it was out of the
torrential rain which had set in and bade fair to
continue, and it was less cold than the open air.</p>

<p>By day and night the orderlies worked, alternately
preparing the place and attending to the
wounded. A solitary English girl who happened
to be on the spot had volunteered her services, and
was doing her best single-handed in the wards.
One day the Major, walking on the quay, saw some
Red Cross nurses. They were the identical ones
we had met on their arrival from Paris. On hearing
they were waiting for their orders, and that
they were all qualified women, he commandeered
them, even as he had commandeered his barn.
Back they came to Headquarters to fetch more
assistance.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come too? It's a case of all
hands aboard!" said one. It was thus I came to
work at the first clearing station at the base. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
was the stationary hospital when, laden with all
the loaves we could carry to supplement the ration
biscuits, we set to work in the "casualty ward"
this afternoon.</p>

<p>For the thousand wounded likely to come
through daily there are six fully-trained nurses
and myself, besides the male staff of R.A.M.C.
doctors and orderlies, and two or three Red Cross
surgeons and lady doctors.</p>

<p>Ten beds and a number of sacks of straw form
the main equipment. Planks, supported by two
packing-cases, are the dressing-table. At one end
men are engaged in putting in three extemporary
baths, others whitewashing the walls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A boatload had just left for England as I came
in, and we proceeded to get a meal for those who
remained. But it was a struggle to get sufficient
tea out of the orderlies, who had been working all
night and were dead beat. The men's delight at
the bread and old newspapers we had brought in
was incredible.</p>

<p>Those who were able to, clustered round
the solitary stove in the centre. Great rough,
bearded fellows, covered with mud from the
trenches in which they have lived for weeks, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
different they look from those who set out! The
worst cases lay on their stretchers as they had
arrived. One said simply, as I took him his tea,
"This is heaven, Sister."</p>

<p>A tall, dark man entered&mdash;the C.O., someone
said. "Take those two Germans down to the
boat," I heard him order. Then, turning to us,
"You'd better come to our mess-room and get
some tea yourselves," he said. "Four trainloads
are expected in shortly."</p>

<p>We trooped into the small sanctum dignified
by the name of "mess-room," where the Major's
orderly was busy preparing tea on a Primus stove.
There was no milk, but the bitter black beverage
out of the large tin mugs was welcome none the
less. Someone had secured a cake that we cut with
a sword as the cleanest thing present.</p>

<p>Next to the mess-room are the officers' quarters
(into which we were privileged to take one
glance)&mdash;small whitewashed cubicles furnished with
a camp bed, a shaving-glass about three inches by
six inches in size, and an old sugar-box converted
into a washstand.</p>

<p>Tea finished, we set to work to get "beds"
ready for the next batch, the first of the four trainloads
expected. Ten bedsteads for a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
men! It sounds almost incredible, but it is nevertheless
true; and although we are told that more
are expected at any moment, we have only wooden
pallets at present and a limited supply of blankets.
One to lie on, two for cover, a coat for a pillow
was the order of the day until a pile of mattresses
came in.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 30th.</i> We worked till midnight and
were on duty again by 7.30 this morning. From our
billets to the hospital is nearly half an hour's walk,
which, over the rough cobblestones in the blinding
rain, is hardly attractive. At any rate, it has the
advantage of clearing the haunting smell of the
gas-gangrene out of our nostrils. As we came on
duty this morning, laden with every old journal we
could find, a huge, burly Scotsman let himself
down from the ambulance train. We gave him a
newspaper, but he was inclined to talk. He is
the first man I've met so far who has signified his
longing to get back to the firing-line.</p>

<p>"While I've a limb left," he said, "I should
like to have a pot at the Germans. And I can fire
my machine as well with two fingers as with five&mdash;if
they'll let me."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;"><a id="i057">

<span class="caption">AT AN IMPROVISED CASUALTY CLEARING STATION<br />"This is Heaven, Sister!"</span>
</a></div>

<p>The cause of his indignation was the mutilated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a><br /><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
corpse of a Red Cross nurse they had found in a
little village where the Germans had been.</p>

<p>"God knows how far they'd dragged her round
with them, but she was horribly mutilated," he
said with a shiver. "I'm a big man, but our
major was bigger, yet neither of us could help
choking. And can ye wonder we want to get at
'em again?"</p>

<p>The worst part of the wounds is the fearful
sepsis and the impossibility of getting them anything
like clean.</p>

<p>"First time I've had my boots off for seven
weeks!" is the kind of exclamation that recurs all
day, as we literally cut them off. Hardly any of
the boots have been off for three weeks, with the
result that they seem glued on, whilst the feet are
like iron, the nails like claws.</p>

<p>Some of the men have not had their wounds
dressed since the first field dressing was applied, for
the simple reason that the rush on the hospital
trains makes it impossible to attend to any but the
worst cases, many of whom, as it is, are dying of
h&aelig;morrhage, accelerated by the jolting on the
journey.</p>

<p>There is no time to do anything but the dressings,
and if we <em>did</em> want to wash the patients there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
is nothing but the red handkerchiefs we hang
round the lights for shades by night, for towels
by day.</p>

<p>Water, especially boiling water, is at a premium,
as it all has to be fetched from outside where
the veteran cook stokes hard all day in the driving
rain, ladling us out a modicum into each bowl
from his cauldrons.</p>

<p>"I never thought to see such sights,"
exclaimed a nurse of thirty years' experience as
a new trainload came in. But we have no time
to think of our own sensations.</p>

<p>Fingerless hands, lungs pierced, arms and legs
pretty well gangrenous, others already threatening
tetanus (against which they are now beginning
to inoculate patients), mouths swollen beyond all
recognition with bullet shots, fractured femurs,
shattered jaws, sightless eyes, ugly scalp wounds;
yet never a murmur, never a groan except in
sleep. As the men come in they fall on their
pallets and doze until roused for food.</p>

<p>A few are enraged to madness at the sight of
a German.</p>

<p>"They fired on our Red Cross!" they cry.
"Burnt every man alive! Why do we treat
them so well?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite a number of prisoners who had been
taken near Lille were brought into the clearing
station this morning. Being the only linguist
present, I was installed as interpreter. They were
in a horrible state of nerves, and asked when they
were likely to be killed.</p>

<p>One of them was nastily peppered about the
heart with shrapnel and asked: "When shall we
be shot?" I explained whilst dressing his wounds
that Britain is a civilised country, and, in contrast
to the Huns, does not hit a man when he is down.
Never shall I forget the look of relief on the man's
face.</p>

<p>"They told us we'd be tortured if you got us!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Later on I was asked to send a card to his
mother. It was difficult to know what to say,
but "Your son, though a prisoner and wounded,
is safe and being well cared for," seemed to meet
the occasion. Suddenly without a word he seized
the scissors from my belt. Recalling tales of
vindictive prisoners, I stepped back. The precaution
was unnecessary, for the little Hun was
only cutting a button off his coat pocket.</p>

<p>"Hier, Sie haben ja nichts genommen"
("Here, you have not taken anything"), he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Teuton boorishness veiling the kindliness
as he handed me the "souvenir."</p>

<p>A strangely human incident occurred a little
later.</p>

<p>A group of Tommies were watching a Boche
having a bayoneted hand dressed. He spoke quite
good English, but was apparently too frightened
to answer any of their sallies. Presently, however,
he turned to me with a request that he might be
allowed to send a line to his wife to say he was
alive.</p>

<p>"'E's young to 'ave a wife, Sister," suggested
a lame man, the maintenance of whose large family
apparently proved a burden to him.</p>

<p>"'Ow old are yer? <em>You?</em>" he added, addressing
the prisoner.</p>

<p>The Hun pulled out an old letter-case and
abstracted the portrait of a pretty English-looking
girl in a garden arbour.</p>

<p>"My vife," he exclaimed. "She has seventeen
years, I nineteen. Ve was married two days
when I come away!"</p>

<p>In a moment the hostile crowd round him was
turned to one of sympathisers. "Poor beggar!
After all, he probably doesn't want to fight any
more than we do," said the lame man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;"><a id="i063">

<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," replied the prisoner, and all the racial
antagonism of Saxon versus Prussian showed
itself in his words, "Ve Saxons not want war&mdash;ve
want peace&mdash;but they not ask us!"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 31st.</i> Who could believe, had they
not seen for themselves, the manifold horrors of
war? The vermin, against which there is no
coping, vermin that in ordinary times one never
saw. The men are alive with them, so are we,
a fact which necessitates a tremendous "search"
at every available opportunity. Even amputated
limbs are found to be crawling.</p>

<p>The girl who was working single-handed in
this barn until we arrived was walking along the
quay yesterday when a feeble voice called her from
a stretcher. It was her brother. He died in the
night, but she is on duty all the same.</p>

<p>All day long the rush continues. The question
"Shrapnel or bullet?" rings incessantly in our
ears as each man comes up to get his dressing done.</p>

<p>One boy of nineteen had no fewer than six
bullet wounds in one arm and two in each leg. It
took two of us an hour to dress his wounds, and
afterwards, as I washed his beardless face in
response to a gentle request, I could scarce refrain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
from sending up a prayer of gratitude that my
own brothers are dead and not mutilated like
these boys.</p>

<p>Towards sunset I was called to the side of a
youthful Saxon already rigid with tetanus.</p>

<p>Through his clenched teeth he could still groan
to the orderly's command to lie still: "Ich kann
nicht still liegen" ("I can't lie still").</p>

<p>At seven o'clock (after nearly twelve hours'
work) we went home to dinner, and, it being our
turn to take night shift, were back again at our
posts, with clean aprons and a satisfied inner man,
two hours later. The orderly officer called for any
who had not yet had their second anti-typhoid
injection, and I, being one of them, was injected
on the spot.</p>

<p>During the long night, as we hurried from
patient to patient in the darkened cry-haunted
ward, covering the restless sleeping figures,
moving them into more comfortable positions,
with a prayer for each one's mother, I could screw
up no feeling of resentment towards the dying
Saxon boy, in spite of the cries of our men, but
only against that vile Prussianism that brought up
its children to regard rapine and slaughter as a
divine necessity. By midnight things were quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
enough to allow us to cut up dressings as best we
might. By this time, owing to there not being
a chair in the place, I confess my legs were almost
giving way. Moreover, the injection took speedy
effect, and a stiffening arm and rising temperature
do not facilitate work of this kind. Frankly, I do
not think any of us will ever be as busy again, and
our one prayer was for strength to "carry on."
Many of the men were tormented by coughs that
kept the others awake. All we had to give them
was lukewarm water and the rinsings of a condensed
milk tin. (For euphony we called it
"milk.")</p>

<p>Those who could not sleep for vermin lit
cigarette after cigarette until their supply ran out.
At 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> we retired to the nurses' "bunk"&mdash;a
whitewashed, rat-ridden, ill-smelling partitioned
compartment, whose sole furniture consisted of
two shelves&mdash;until someone was inspired to fetch
the "dressing-table" (two empty boxes&mdash;oh, joy
of joys! upon which we took it in turns to sit)&mdash;and
a coke fire, on which we boiled eggs for our
midnight meal. Half-way through my egg the
orderly called me: "The prisoner can't last
much longer. Will you come and speak to him,
Sister?" It seemed as if the ward were one huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
battlefield, for cries greeted me on all sides. "Get
at 'em, lads!" shouted the burly Scot in the corner
as he urged forward his comrades in his sleep.
"Christ help us!" groaned an armless dragoon,
coming round from the an&aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>I soothed the dying German as best I could
when the awful spasms came, and through his
clenched teeth he signified the pain in the
"kreuz" (small of the back). What could I say
but "Guter Junge&mdash;bleib still. Es dauert nicht
mehr lange!" ("Good boy&mdash;lie still. It will not
last long now!") With his remaining hand he
pressed mine as I wiped the pouring sweat
from his brow. After all, suffering is a great
leveller.</p>

<p>The orderly, an old South African campaigner,
looked at the light that began to flood the sky.</p>

<p>"They usually go West at this hour," he
remarked grimly, with a shudder. I shuddered
too; the place was alive with spirits.</p>

<p>For a moment we seemed to hear the sigh of
the departing, feel the rushing of many wings as
they brushed past. Then a gaunt, muffled figure
appeared at the door bearing a lantern, for all the
world like a hoary figure of "Time," and we
awoke to reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've brought down a trainload," he said.
"A round dozen of them are urgent cases and
must have beds."</p>

<p>Perforce we had to shift the sleeping forms on
to the concrete floor, all bruised and torn and
bleeding though they were, cutting shorter their
all too short rest.</p>

<p>An officer was brought in wounded in the
abdomen, but cheerfully talking of getting home.
He, too, passed away before eight o'clock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the nursing point of view the work is
most unsatisfactory, as disinfectants, to say
nothing of dressings, are continually at low ebb.
To-day the iodine ran out. One of the surgeons
came round and signified his intention to dress a
bad femur case. I had got together what things
I could when he called for iodine. There being
none to be had, he sighed resignedly, and with
"Then we will leave the dressings for the present,"
walked off, only to return an hour later with a
quantity he had found in the town.</p>

<p>Of course there can be no attempt at asepsis
in a place so ill ventilated, or, rather, not ventilated
at all, for there are no side windows, and,
although the skylight is sufficient for lighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
purposes, the ventilation is effected by means of
the excessively draughty entrances.</p>

<p>It is distinctly unhealthy, and the odours in
the place are indescribable and never to be forgotten.
There is no lavatory accommodation&mdash;although
latrines are situated along the quay,
whither the blind are led by the armless, the lame
carried on orderlies' backs.</p>

<p>Refuse of all sorts that cannot be burned in
the incinerator is disposed of in the sea, and it is
good to note that the sacks of straw are being
gradually replaced by <em>real</em> beds and the supply of
blankets is greatly augmented.</p>

<p>Unsatisfactory, too, from the nursing point of
view is the fact that the men pass through the
clearing station so rapidly that we seldom do the
same dressing twice; and though there <em>are</em> days
when, owing to rough seas or overladen boats, we
are able to watch the progress of the patients, for
the most part it is only the immovable cases that
remain, and the rest are hurried through, leaving
one wondering how they will get on.</p>

<p>Did I say <em>hurried</em> through? There is no need
to hurry the men who are to go home, for no
sooner is a boat announced than a general scramble
ensues, and they will leave their breakfast, clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
even their treasured trophies behind, in order
not to be late.</p>

<p>"Just a bit of 'ome, and we'll be twice as
strong for the next bit o' fightin'," they say.</p>

<p>There follows the inspection of labels (for each
man is labelled for his destination: blue for
England, yellow for Havre, white for a convalescent
depot), and sad indeed are the faces of
those to whom the medical officer has not vouchsafed
the coveted blue ticket.</p>


<p>Just as day dawned, with a last spasm, more
awful than the others, the little Saxon prisoner
died. As his close-clenched jaws relaxed the
orderly remarked: "Not bad-looking for a corpse,
Sister; must have been a pretty child!"</p>

<p>I asked for his corpse number, but it was not
to be found. In my heart I wished the boy's
mother could have known he died well cared for.</p>

<p>It is all very primitive; we have no screens to
hide what once was mortal from the others.</p>

<p>We came off duty at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, just as another
batch of 1,100 men began to arrive, and on our
way home caught a glimpse of K. of K., who is
paying an incognito visit, as he stepped from a
destroyer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<small>November, 1914</small></h2>


<p><i>November 1st.</i> It is impossible to keep note
of the daily occurrences. Things move too quickly
out here&mdash;besides, if the spirit is willing the flesh
is very exhausted. Nevertheless, not for a moment
do our spirits flag; on the contrary, the worse
things grow the more cheerful do we become, the
more determined to make the best of things. It
is strange that all the years we worked hard to
amuse ourselves at home not one brought an
eighth of the satisfaction of <em>this</em>.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful dearth of utensils, though
the store grows larger daily. It is no infrequent
occurrence to have to sally out to the nearest
chemist to buy air cushions, eye baths, etc., as
they are required.</p>

<p>Night, and the wards are full. Another train
disgorges its burden. The stretcher cases have to
remain on stretchers. The walking cases are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
huddled round the stove, extended on the concrete,
their blood-stained, bug-ridden greatcoats
for coverings.</p>

<p>Without, for a moment the rain has ceased,
and in the clear night the moon smiles peacefully
over the silver, gleaming sea.</p>

<p>What a contrast to the scene within!
The restless figures of the wounded&mdash;the busy
nurses.</p>

<p>Everyone is exhausted, for it is an almost
superhuman task for seven women to tackle by
day and by night; but they say the Army Nursing
Service will be here in sufficient numbers soon.
The lady doctors have been invaluable, their zeal
unflagging. They are splendid operators, and in
the midst of the worst rushes never careless.
Besides their work here they spend much time
at the "Women's Hospital" at a ch&acirc;teau
some three miles out of Boulogne, where
everything is run by volunteer women workers,
who act as doctors, nurses, orderlies and quartermasters.</p>

<p>The theatre looks quite smart, with the large
sterilisers that have been installed and the operating
table. What tales those whitewashed walls could
tell!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Will those who are knitting away at home
ever realise the value of their own handiwork, I
wonder?</p>

<p>If they could but see the eager faces of the
men as the meagre stores are issued, and they
receive those ill-fitting coats, and socks, and card-board-footed
shoes (the nightingales they one and
all disdain); could they for a single moment
glance at the contented expression of the
"movable cases" as they wriggle out of their
creeping shirts, so torn, so stiff with congealed
blood and stained with Flanders mud, into
garments that are both soft and warm, all those
hours of patient knitting would be well rewarded;
they would know they are not labouring
in vain.</p>

<p>In spite of the so-called "Red Cross Store
Room" that is being replenished daily by stock
drawn from all sources, of course there aren't
enough things to go round, and although we
grouse at the wise quartermaster's inquiries as to
whether each article we need is an imperative
necessity or not, in our heart of hearts we know
him to be in the right.</p>

"The theatre looks quite smart with the huge sterilisers that have been installed

</a></div>

<p>A strange thing happened to-day. A man
came in with a badly shattered forearm. I dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a><br />
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a><br />
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
it myself, and can vouch for the fact that in other
respects he seemed fit enough.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards one of his companions disengaged
himself from the group by the stove and
came to me, saying: "Sister, that man has gone
blind suddenly."</p>

<p>I remarked it must be nonsense, and told him
to go to sleep. Nevertheless, on passing a light
before the other man's eyes there was never a
flicker. He was blind, as the medical officer can
vouch; whether it is temporary or not we shall
never know, for the cases pass through so
quickly.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 2nd.</i> Someone has been asked to
volunteer to run the military baths. I, being the
one whose work in hospital must be of least value,
naturally did so, and was accepted.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 3rd.</i> Most of the men are very
subdued, and either loath to talk of what they
have been through or ultra-full of reminiscences,
many of which have to be taken with a grain of
salt.</p>

<p>A large percentage of them stammer or have
developed a nervous impediment in their speech,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
owing, no doubt, to the strain of the past months;
and this is very often the case in Territorial regiments,
whose members were accustomed to a more
or less easy life in peace time.</p>

<p>Quite a number of the London Scottish&mdash;whose
"charge" has been so boomed by the daily
papers as a proof of the efficiency of the Territorial
Army&mdash;are coming down now. They are very
annoyed and very ashamed of the fuss that has
been made of them.</p>

<p>"We only did what is done by one regiment
or another every day," they said, "and now we
hardly like to show our faces for the ridicule that
must be cast upon us by the Regulars, who have
seen ten times as much fighting and never been
mentioned at all."</p>

<p>The "dum-dum" lie is no lie at all. Anyone
who has seen the strangely mutilated limbs can
vouch for that. In one case the bullet passed
clean through one leg and exploded in the other.
Bah! the smell of the gas gangrene&mdash;shall we ever
forget it?</p>

<p>We hear many tales about the Germans from
the men. Devoid of honour, they train machine-guns
on ambulances, and accredit us with the same
devilish tricks. One French civilian ambulance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
unit was totally destroyed a few days back, and
wounded, surgeons, stretcher-bearers and nurses
alike were blown to atoms.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 7th.</i> I am now installed as "Lady
Superintendent of Military Baths," an entirely
new post!</p>

<p>The scene of my activities is the public baths
in the Rue des Vieillards, that have been rented
from the old proprietress. With six orderlies to
do the rough work&mdash;the washing of towels, the
cleaning of the twenty baths, and my own spacious
office in which to do the men's dressings&mdash;things
are cheerful enough.</p>

<p>About 100 men come through each day&mdash;the
convalescents in the morning, so that the whole
forenoon is taken up with dressings.</p>

<p>The difficulties at first were many, a fact which
considerably enhanced the joy of the work.</p>

<p>1. To get the place clean was a veritable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i>.</p>

<p>2. Drawing things from the Ordnance is no
easy matter. One must not buy what may be
drawn; and as I have no notion of what can be
drawn there is often considerable delay.</p>

<p>3. Persuading the orderlies that water for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
dressings must be boiled, and not lukewarm, is
likewise far from easy.</p>

<p>The days are no longer so strenuous. I arrive
at eight to see that the men are getting on with
their work, cut up dressings, leave out and mark
towels until ten o'clock, when the convalescents
begin to arrive.</p>

<p>By 3.30 I am able to go down to the clearing
station to write letters for the helpless.</p>

<p>To-day a man who was brought in with a badly
fractured pelvis dictated one to his brother. It
ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,&mdash;After going through all the
big battles of Mons, the Marne and the Aisne, I
am sad to say I've got hit at last, but hope soon
to be home with you all. I'm glad to know you've
joined to be a soldier, and hope soon to hear you're
helping in the fight."</p></blockquote>

<p>"It isn't true, Sister," he added; "but perhaps
it will help him through, poor fellow&mdash;if I
die!"</p>

<p>Needless to say, none of the hospital personnel
have time to sandwich letter-writing for the men
in between their medical work, and civilian help
is welcome in this matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>No one who has not seen the intricacies of the
office work of a large military hospital can have
the least conception what an amount of forethought,
what a number of clerks are involved.
The distribution of the wounded into the different
wards, the notification and specification of each
case&mdash;each is an art in itself. Whilst in the
quartermaster's domain the drawing of rations for
an elastic number of patients, ranging each meal
from 50 to 400, is wellnigh stupendous.</p>

<p>And although we who know nothing of these
matters have often laughed at the theoretical red
tape of the Army, there is no denying that, in
working order, it is a thing to be venerated rather
than scoffed at.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 8th, On the Ramparts of Boulogne.</i>
After the hush of the unornamental cathedral the
soft autumn breezes out here are refreshing. Even
in the well ventilated baths the pungent smell of
segregated humanity permeates. What a strange
place is Boulogne now, the city of hospitals, every
hotel a hospital, every road thronged with troops
and nurses!</p>

<p>Yesterday I had a slight fracas with my
corporal, a nice but utterly untrained boy, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
has a way of wandering into the office, cigarette
in mouth.</p>

<p>Now, there is no law in the Army, so far as I
can make out, that compels an orderly to pay the
slightest respect toward a nurse. He must stand
at attention when addressed by a junior subaltern,
but may loll and smoke at his ease whilst taking
a nursing sister's orders. Thus it seems that from
time immemorial a slight antagonism has reigned,
for the men are apt to take advantage of a woman,
who, unless she have infinite tact, often enough
finds things hard.</p>

<p>However, after two cups of black coffee to
give me the requisite courage, I faced the little
difficulty boldly. "Corporal," I suggested, "it
doesn't matter what you do outside, but I would
rather you didn't smoke in the office. You set the
example to the others, who are beginning to turn
the office into a sort of smoking-room. Besides, it
isn't usual in the Service, is it?"</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence, as the poor
boy blushed and grunted. Then I changed
the subject, and think all will be well,
for though surly in manner he is most anxious to
please.</p>

<p>One afternoon I was asked to go and speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to some prisoners at the Imperial (No. &mdash;&mdash;
General Hospital), where Miss A&mdash;&mdash; is now
working. A young "Freiwillige" of 19 immediately
inquired: "What about Paris?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"When did we take it?" was the somewhat
surprising reply.</p>

<p>On the whole, in spite of the rigorous discipline
that makes it necessary for German officers to go
behind their men to save their own skins and goad
on their victims; in spite of the fact that they seem
to be treated like cattle and have been found
chained to their machine-guns, as a whole (and
probably as the outcome of the patriotism that is
inculcated into every German from his earliest
days) they seem loyal to their superiors; and,
relieved though they appear at being captured,
are not garrulous on the score of the reign of
terrorism from which they have escaped. For
not the most warlike can covet the privilege of
being driven in massed formation, over heaped-up
corpses, into the face of the enemy's fire that
literally mows them down like hay. It turns
even our own machine-gun men sick.</p>

<p>As we were about to turn in, ten funerals
went up without even an escort, as the R.A.M.C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
orderlies are too engrossed with their duties towards
the living to be spared.</p>

<p>So die the flower of English manhood! Buried
in their deal boards in French clay, with only a
French grave-digger or two and a cluster of children
playing round the massive gates to see them
to their last resting-place.</p>

<p>Well might the bells of Shoreditch peal,
muffled, on All Saints' Day!</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 9th.</i> The autumn leaves are falling.
Before me sit a group of convalescents in the
courtyard, basking in what there is of mellow sunlight&mdash;awaiting
their turn for baths. To say they
look dejected is too mild. There is a look of
weariness in their eyes that appals one. There is
no mistaking a man from the front. They all
have it&mdash;the trench-haunted look.</p>

<p>"Any man who says he <em>wants</em> to go back is a
liar," say most. "It isn't fighting; it's murder,
you see." And one is left all the more astounded
at the heroism with which they face the inevitable
when it comes to returning to the front, the
unanimity of their: "Are we down-hearted?
<em>Never!</em>" as they march off.</p>

<p>On the whole there is wonderfully little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
"swinging the lead" or "dodging the column,"
as the men themselves call malingering; and
though some of the medical officers were apt to
look upon the early cases of trench feet as much
ado about nothing, it has since been found that
the acutest pain is often present when all swelling
has subsided.</p>

<p>It is a relief to get back in the evenings to the
society of the nurses. Many of them already look
knocked up. "Fifty patients on my floor, and
only two orderlies," says one. And at home
thousands of trained workers are waiting for work.</p>

<p>We often wonder that no use is made of the
members of the Voluntary Aid Detachments as
probationers under the trained nurses. True, in
their present stage of efficiency (or inefficiency,
for what are a number of first-aid lectures or
stretcher drills as compared with the real hospital
training?) many of them might prove more of a
hindrance than a help in an emergency. Nevertheless,
they could be of as much use as probationers
out here&mdash;where, everything having been
improvised, the inconveniences necessitate much
extra labour&mdash;as they could be at home.</p>

<p>It is ridiculous to imagine that V.A.D.'s,
with their theoretical experience, are competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to run hospitals by themselves; it is equally
ridiculous to allow the valuable qualified nurses to
run themselves to death, doing jobs an untrained
woman can do, instead of utilising the many eager
workers willing to take over the menial work.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>It will not be hard to sift the wheat from the
chaff, the seekers after sensation from the genuine
workers. For there is no romance in the work of
a hospital, no jaunts to battlefields bearing cups
of water to the dying, no soothing of pillows and
holding the hands of patients; but ten to twelve
hours each day occupied in the accomplishment of
tasks so menial that one would hesitate to ask a
servant to perform them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This has since been done, and members of Voluntary Aid Detachments
are now used extensively in France as probationers in military
hospitals where they come under direct War Office control.</p></div>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 10th.</i> We awaken to bugle calls,
we fall asleep to the sound of tramping feet. Oh,
that long weary high road into the jaws of death!
The sudden evacuation of Boulogne seems less
imminent now than it did, though the German
advance on Calais continues. Now that England
has declared war on Turkey, we realise how little
of the big scheme of things we see in our niche.
Sometimes, between waking and sleeping, a vision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of home comes back to me, of soft carpets and
steaming hot baths, and everywhere clean linen and
creature comforts and ease. After all, I should
like to end my days as I began them&mdash;in luxury.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 11th.</i> No wonder Boulogne is full
to overflowing. No wonder the little out-of-the-way
caf&eacute;s have taken on something of the glamour
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i> of Rumpelmayer or the Ritz. No wonder
everyone who can afford to be is in France.
One feels it in the air, it is the Real Thing; one
is no longer a looker-on, but a moving factor of
things who can afford to pity those at home whose
activities have not yet had occasion to be called
into play.</p>

<p>The town itself consists of the Haute Ville
enclosed by massive thirteenth century ramparts
flanked by round towers, whose history for years
centred round Godfrey de Bouillon, and the four
celebrated gates (Porte Gayole, Porte des Dunes,
Porte de Calais and Porte des Degr&eacute;s). Crowning
all stands the Cath&eacute;drale de Notre Dame, whose
dome from the distance, whether viewed from the
town or the environing country, brings back faint
remembrances of St. Peter's in the Holy City.</p>

<p>There is nothing of great artistic interest or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
value to be found within (unless it be the seventh
century antiquities in the crypt), but the spirit of
earnest devotion that characterises all Catholic
places of worship, uniting every worshipper and
raising the lowliest edifice to equality with the
most ambitious building, is more marked here than
in any church I have yet visited. The reverence
of the bare-headed peasants, holding up their
woollen shawls as coverings for their heads, of the
shambling wounded, of the smart <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mondaines</i>, is
alike worthy of those Russian allies who recognise
no sin greater than lack of veneration to their God.</p>

<p>The legend of the miraculous statue of Our
Lady of Boulogne, as depicted in a picture over
the altar of the chapel in the cathedral, dates back
to the year 636. In that year a strange boat,
radiating with light, was seen to enter the harbour,
propelled by some miraculous power and
devoid of sailors or pilot. When the excited population
reached the shore it was to find on the
bridge of the barque a beautifully carved image of
the Holy Virgin carrying the infant Jesus, beside
which lay a silver-bound copy of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>Over the spot that marked the miraculous
image's first resting-place in the Haute Ville the
oft-destroyed cathedral has grown, and although,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
after many vicissitudes, the Holy Statue was
finally destroyed during the eighteenth century
Reign of Terror, many are the pilgrimages still
made to the solitary relic of the holy image&mdash;a
hand that was cut off prior to the burning,
which is preserved in a gilt heart, suspended from
the new statue.</p>

<p>The fame of its miracles spread abroad so
widely that not only did kings and princes hasten
to pay homage, but some unscrupulous priests at
St. Cloud attracted large numbers of pilgrims by
trafficking in the public faith and maintaining that
<em>they</em> were in possession of the miraculous statue.
Hence the name of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris,
and the fact that the image is known as Our Lady
of Boulogne-sur-Mer.</p>

<p>Beyond Notre Dame runs the Calais&mdash;St.
Omer road which has seen so much bloody traffic
in the past and may see so much more in a few
days.</p>

<p>Guns, ammunition convoys and ambulances
rumble along it ceaselessly by day and night, pausing
only to answer the challenge of the sentries
posted at intervals at every cross-road of importance.
The ruined Jesuit monastery lies along
this road, alive with wounded Indians, who, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
convalescent, are shifted into the outlying tents
that form the Convalescent Depot.</p>

<p>Only about one mile away on the same road
stands the Colonne de la Grande Arm&eacute;e, that huge
Doric column surmounted by the figure of
Napoleon, erected to commemorate the expedition
against England and commenced 110 years ago,
when Marshal Soult (as the inscription on the base
tells us) laid the first stone in the presence of the
whole army.</p>

<p>Walking townwards one comes across the fisher
village built in tier upon tier of squalid, unsanitated
streets, as odorous as the Naples of ten years ago&mdash;and
as picturesque; and pinnacled by St. Pierre-des-Marins,
whose lofty fourteenth century Gothic
spire is one of the few architectural beauties to
be found here, and whose interior, so full of votive
offerings, witnesses the toll of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">matelot</i> lives exacted
yearly by the sea from those who would snatch
their living from her.</p>

<p>Crowning all stands the revered Calvary to
which all wise fishermen pray as they sail in and
out of the harbour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i091">
<img src="images/i091.jpg" width="600" height="342" alt="THE REVERED CALVARY TO WHICH ALL WISE FISHERMEN PRAY" />
<span class="caption">"THE REVERED CALVARY TO WHICH ALL WISE FISHERMEN PRAY"</span>
</a></div>

<p>From here the panorama of the whole place is
laid bare, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jet&eacute;es</i>, the coast, the Gare Maritime,
the Bassin Loubet, the River Liane winding in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a><br />
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a><br />
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
out of the valley and losing itself finally in the
mists; and nearer, the gay flower-market and the
Halle des Poissons, where the vendors, almost as
soon as the nets of herrings are unladen, are rid
of what fish they can get in these troublous times,
when every man who is not fighting is trawling
for mines.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 12th.</i> As I sit beside the dying
embers of my office fire, in which great valleys and
gorges are discernible in the glowing coal and a
mountainous summit capped by a fairy castle, I
wonder what happiness there is to equal the fireside
that one has earned oneself.</p>

<p>It might almost be home (after all, all fires,
like all winds and sunshine, or thunder and rain,
are consolingly the same!), only instead of soft pile
carpets and arm-chairs I have a packing-case for
seat and an inverted saucepan on my knee for
table. Instead of flowers, the trestled table is
adorned with bandages and bottles of lotion and
packets of dressings.</p>

<p>Instead of a gong to announce "dressing
time," and soft <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">d&eacute;collet&eacute;e</i> frocks donned before
long mirrors, and well-appointed dining-tables and
the announcement that "Dinner is served," there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
are only the promptings of my hungry inside to
tell me mealtime is due, and it would be as well
to scrub up, remove the mackintosh apron, and
smooth my hair under the unbecoming white cap
before the dinner is gobbled up!</p>

<p>Yet, until one has worked five hours to earn
five minutes' rest, one does not know the meaning
of leisure.</p>

<p>Until one has felt the clinging of the helpless
hand, or run to the call of a feeble voice, one does
not know the greatest of all joys&mdash;the joy of
service.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the Gare Maritime
Hospital is developing is marvellous. Instead of
wallowing to our ankles in a slush of disinfectant
and rain-water, the wards are well swept, with two
strips of cheery red carpet on either side. Instead
of boards and blankets, some 200 real beds have
been installed, with sheets of coarse calico and
pillows. Instead of empty crates (and those at a
premium) there are chairs, whilst towels supplant
the red handkerchiefs which now hang desolately
from the lamps by night <em>and</em> day.</p>

<p>Just at present the casualty ward, in which an
emergency operation theatre has been opened, is
lying empty, so are the other wards. One wonders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
why? The truth is, things are looking fairly bad.
The enemy is only forty-five miles from Calais and
still presses on to the goal. There is a rumour that
the Germans are through the lines everywhere, that
we have no men to send (though the French are
supposed to be reinforcing) until the 8th Division
of "K's" untrained army comes out, and the
evacuation of Boulogne is imminent. We are told
to be prepared to leave at a minute's notice, for
once through the lines the enemy can march here
unmolested. Despite the violent storm, all the
wounded whom it is possible to move have been
sent home (an ominous fact, for their removal
should betoken an advance on our part), and still
the ambulance trains come back from the front
empty. A pestilential battle rages at Arras;
Dixmude has fallen (yes, several of the Censor's
censors have been dismissed for letting us know
this!) A hundred questions assail us. Will the
hopeless cases have to be left behind? What will
be done to the many millions' worth of stores in
this spy-ridden place?</p>

<p>Heaven knows! We can but "wait and see."</p>

<p>We are lost in amazement at the lukewarmness
of the masses at home who do not seem to realise
the significance of this move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>But let me return to No. &mdash;&mdash; Stationary Hospital,
where the staff is greatly augmented and
Army nurses work side by side with those of the
Red Cross.</p>

<p>If there is some slight friction between the
two it is easily understood, for how can the newly
arrived Army sisters be expected to find in a dirty,
evil-smelling barn anything but the violation of all
the laws of hygiene? Whereas to those Red Cross
sisters, who have built it up with their life's blood,
so to speak, who have watched it evolve under their
weary fingers, it is a place of supreme beauty and
first importance.</p>

<p>If there is some slight friction amongst the
authorities, too, it is soon explained. For it is
as much the duty of the Red Cross to cherish its
own rights as it is for the Army to centralise and
control, at a time like this, every existing institution
to prevent the misuse of public funds.</p>

<p>Both are in the right.</p>

<p>At home no one seemed quite to realise the
exact position of the Red Cross and the various
Army medical services. Out here, except that a
distinct antagonism between the two organisations
prevails, the position is equally vague.</p>

<p>The British Red Cross Society and the St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
John Ambulance Association were originally
formed to supplement the requirements of the
military and naval medical services in war time,
thus obviating the expense of keeping up an
exceptionally large staff in days of peace. On
this understanding the War Office took nominal
control of the various B.R.C.S. enterprises, supervising
the First Aid examinations and keeping a
register of all its members. The value of that
registration of B.R.C.S. members by the War
Office is not quite obvious at present, for the
War Office appears to disclaim all responsibility
for the Red Cross. There are even rumours that
a large portion of its personnel is to be greatly
reduced and eventually sent from the base. In
fact, no one's work or position is clearly defined.</p>

<p>The work of the Royal Army Medical Corps,
the Nursing Service, "Q.A.I.M.N.S.," Reserve,
Indian and Territorial, was well defined
enough. Field ambulances, clearing stations,
stationary hospitals (so-called because they are
movable!) and base hospitals were their sphere,
and vaguely it was understood that the Voluntary
Aid Detachments were destined for use with the
Territorial Forces.</p>

<p>Then, when at the outbreak of hostilities there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
came the call for more workers, many doctors and
fully-trained nurses, anxious to get to that
mysterious and alluring unknown, the Front,
threw up their good posts and sold their
patiently built-up practices in order to join the
Red Cross.</p>

<p>Many of them are already regretting their
impetuousness. Not only the members of the
Voluntary Aid Detachments, who have hitherto
played at work under War Office supervision and
with War Office sanction, but the much-needed
trained nurses and doctors (many of them
specialists of the first order) find themselves somewhat
shelved, oftentimes deprived of the best
surgical work by those of their juniors who had
had the foresight or good luck to join the Reserve
or Territorials instead of a volunteer concern
whose position is, as yet, indefinite and whose
scope, so far, limited. Many even find themselves
on the Reserve Staff and waiting for work. A
certain restlessness that prevails amongst these
is easily explained, for it is not always possible
to console oneself with the idea that inaction is
merely a respite and preparation for the next call
upon one's energies, when that call is lying all
around in understaffed hospitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 13th.</i> Perhaps it was the unconquerable
instinct to help lame dogs over stiles that
prompted the Matron to ask after some German
literature for a prisoner whose two legs had been
amputated. I, as linguist and jack-of-all-trades,
was deputed to forage for Hun books, and, for the
first time, found my conversance with the language
a matter of embarrassment rather than of pride.</p>

<p>As I entered the French bookseller's, and asked
for what I wanted, the girl eyed me with suspicion.
Then, "We are not pro-German," she said with
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hauteur</i>.</p>

<p>Fearful to return, my mission unaccomplished,
I tried shop after shop.</p>

<p>"You can climb on that ladder and see for
yourself," said a young girl, pointing to a high
ladder and daring me up it with her scornful eyes.
I unearthed and returned with an old paper-backed
novel for the prisoner, with a heavy heart, wondering
if I was unpatriotic to have carried out my
orders&mdash;but the legless man had died in the
meantime.</p>

<p>Such is the spirit of France&mdash;vengeance on a
ruthless, untrustworthy enemy.</p>

<p>Such the spirit of England, maybe hyper-quixotic&mdash;never
to hit a man when he is down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 15th.</i> Last night Lord Roberts
died. The little wrinkled old man, who only a
week ago was in our midst, walking round our
wards, cheering on the wounded, encouraging the
Indians, has finished as he began, in the sphere of
action.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 17th.</i> This morning the mail boat
is accompanied by six French destroyers. In the
town all flags are flying half-mast; in the station
are massed guards, French, English, Indian. The
Sikhs are fine-looking specimens of humanity, and
objects of great interest to the peasants who crowd
round exchanging souvenirs. The smaller hillmen
look as if they would be very formidable foes,
though at present many of them lie curled up
asleep on sacks, and covered with sacks, as peacefully
as children.</p>


<p><i>Later.</i> After the coffin of the great little man,
who has, alas! lived to see his worst fears for his
country realised, had been borne on board, we went
to look at the armoured train that is in hospital.
A strange, formidable-looking thing, too, is this
vehicle of destruction, daubed with many-hued,
very futuristic patches, and guarded by sentries.</p>

<p>A large legend announced the train's destination
as "Berlin," whilst great guns, daubed with
their appropriate names, "Homeless Hector" and
"Weary Willie," pointed their inquiring noses
innocuously at the sky.</p>

<p>This, we were told, was the armoured train
which, under Commander Samson's guidance,
played such havoc with the enemy and caused the
Kaiser to put a price worth having on that gallant
officer's head.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 23rd.</i> The baths closed most suddenly
and unexpectedly last night. The owners'
exorbitant demands for money&mdash;damages for
towels which we have not even used, walls, ceilings,
windows, etc., that are in the same good
repair as when we came&mdash;have made it imperative
to commandeer the place or, to avoid friction and
expense, erect new ones.</p>

<p>After the Major and his interpreter driver
(a dentist who volunteered his services) had
spent nearly two hours haranguing Madame
and her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">homme d'affaires</i>, we cleared the place
out.</p>

<p>Snow fell for the first time during the night,
and it is freezing so hard this morning that the hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
water thrown over the stones outside for cleansing
purposes becomes ice at once.</p>

<p>Having a free day, I explored the place from
Le Portel, the quaint little fishing village where
fishwives, with their wide, hooped skirts, their
quaint poke bonnets or characteristic snowy white
headgear and clogs, predominate, to the St. Pierre
quarter, cobbled like the new town itself, but built
in tier after tier of terraces, characterised by an
indescribable, if picturesque, squalor and dirt.</p>

<p>Everywhere we are followed by children begging
for "souvenirs." I wonder what the state
of our clothes would be had we cut off a uniform
button for each one who asked!</p>

<p>The tide is high up over the front to-day.
Ambulances and cars are held up on the Wimereux
road. It is a wonderful sight, the big waves rolling
over the main road, whilst venturesome drivers
who run the gauntlet find their cars immovable
in three feet of water and subject to the ungentle
washing of the sea.</p>

<p class="mt2"><i>November 24th.</i> Being on night duty with a
private patient who is so restless that neither of
us gets a minute's peace, I am having an excellent
opportunity of observing things as they are; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a><br />

after all, there is plenty to be noted that will never
be brought to light.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 29th.</i> In the morning when one
comes off duty, full of anticipation of the exhilarating
morning walk, the joy of the clear, cold sea
air, there are usually plenty of odd jobs to be done.
At present we are engaged in making sandbags for
those hospitals which are destitute of them. In
this we have the assistance of two small French Boy
Scouts who, having noticed us staggering under
the load of our baskets, volunteered to find a wheelbarrow
and bring us up a certain quantity of sand
every morning.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<small>December, 1914</small></h2>


<p><i>December 2nd</i>. They say that the Germans
have been finally driven back, that our men are enjoying
a rest from the trenches, that many officers
have gone home on forty-eight hours' leave.</p>

<p>Converted motor-buses with boarded windows,
all of steel-grey hue, come down with loads of
cheery though exhausted men on their way home.</p>

<p>Most of the cases in hospital are now medical,
rheumatism and the newest disease, "trench feet,"
which was at first identified as frost-bite. Each
medical officer has a different method for treating
it. Most wrap the limbs in cotton-wool, but the
agony the men go through whilst "thawing" is
awful. Many feet are already gangrenous and
have to be amputated.</p>

<p>They are again clearing out, which leads us to
expect a big battle.</p>

<p>Rumour has it that Belgrade has fallen to the
Austrians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 6th.</i> Yesterday morning, having
for some weeks back collected with great avidity
all kinds of comforts for the men, I took my goods
up to the convalescent camp that stands on the
hill by the Calais road. We obtained a lift in an
ambulance and wallowed in the indescribable mud
at the camp. It had been a frightful night. Hail,
wind, thunder, lightning, blinding rain&mdash;the
elements let loose! Several of the tents were
down, and the men shivered as they ambled about
their light fatigue work. The condition of the convalescents
is pitiable. They grabbed things like
so many wild beasts; indeed, they had the look of
weary wild beasts in their eyes.</p>

<p>I don't know which were the more acceptable&mdash;cigarettes
or old papers. The former to soothe
their racked nerves and warm them up in the
tempestuous weather, the latter to divert their
attention, momentarily at least, from their own
sufferings. Undoubtedly the illustrated journals
are most useful. The men seem unable to concentrate
their attention on anything not pictorial.</p>

<p>We took them knitted things too&mdash;and even
our own body belts and gloves were requisitioned
in the vain effort to make our gifts go round, and
we came home with hands stiff with cold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 8th.</i> In the afternoon we were
allowed a glimpse at the Indian camp, where, after
seeing the wards, conspicuous for their neatness
and order and the lack of nurses (all Indian
hospitals are staffed, needless to say, by orderlies),
we were entertained for tea in the officers'
mess.</p>

<p>It was a picturesque sight, that tent lighted
by two smoky oil-lamps, by the light of which
four doctors were playing cards as we entered.</p>

<p>As we sat over the camp fire of glowing coals
in a perforated bucket such as night watchmen
warm their hands by in the raw London mornings,
a sudden squall arose, threatening to bring the tent
down. One felt like part of an Arctic expedition
at the overhead crash, the icy blast, and could not
help surmising as to the thoughts of the Indians
at the caprices of the European climate as their
great, wistful eyes rested on the barren fields.</p>

<p>The tales of their pluck, recuperative powers,
and apparent imperviousness to pain are astounding.
The medical officers told us that it is almost
impossible to keep them in bed. No sooner are
they round from an an&aelig;sthetic than they are up
and smoking, quite oblivious of an amputated
limb!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 12th, 2 a.m.</i> A dark, starless morning,
and we have just arrived back from Dunkirk.
The road to Calais, when we left twelve hours ago,
was fairly plain sailing.</p>

<p>There were the barriers to pass (some fifteen
between Boulogne and Dunkirk) where the
"laissez-passer," describing car, occupants, destination
and object of visit, etc., has to be shown;
and in between we scorched along at top speed,
thankful for the fact that there is no speed limit in
France, and getting frozen through and through
despite our furs and rugs.</p>

<p>After Calais things grew more interesting. For
the first time entrenchments, barbed-wire defences
and guns hove in sight, whilst here and there the
desolate stretches of country were relieved by
figures against the skyline&mdash;old women working
in the fields, or a solitary picket of soldiers.</p>

<p>We drew into Dunkirk about four o'clock;
each of us had different business to transact; the
four men on Red Cross work, I on a visit to Lady
S&mdash;&mdash;, in charge of a Belgian hospital.</p>

<p>Incidentally, there were the streets and houses
to visit, destroyed only yesterday by German
bombs. A miserable spectacle they were, the
skeleton ruins in the pouring rain; no less miserable-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
than we, covered in the thick Flanders
mud that defied all efforts to keep it out of the
car.</p>

<p>It was almost dinner-time when we found ourselves
at the C&mdash;&mdash; Hotel, and, whilst the men
were sipping their vermouth, we noticed a man
busily engaged in what <em>seemed</em> to be letter- but
what <em>proved</em> to be leader-writing. He introduced
himself as C&mdash;&mdash;, the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> correspondent
whose articles adorn the central pages of that
paper.</p>

<p>Truly the path of the war correspondents of
to-day lies along no bed of roses! Eyed with suspicion
by the authorities, forced to change their
abode daily, they lead the life of veritable refugees.</p>

<p>The dining-room was a fine sight, as by degrees
it filled up, each table resplendent with Belgian,
French or British uniforms; and we were loath to
leave the warm hotel for the blinding rain without.
Whilst waiting for the car Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; entertained
us at the piano; anything we asked for he played&mdash;rag-time,
opera, comedy, classical music. And
the last sound, rendered more beautiful by means
of his exquisite touch, that greeted us as we passed
into the night was the haunting Barcarolle from
the <cite>Tales of Hoffmann</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at Gravelines that we lost our way, at
about ten o'clock. It was pitch dark. Nowhere
a light visible, only the powerful acetylene headlamps
of the car. We tried to find the main road
and instead found ourselves back in the town. We
made another effort, but failed. We aroused the
inhabitants of a house where there seemed to be a
red glow behind the closed shutters.</p>

<p>"Tout droit," they told us.</p>

<p>We went "tout droit," and found ourselves
back again. We fetched out the proprietor of a
hopeful-looking bar.</p>

<p>"Tout droit," he said. This time we ran into
a barrier, and only just escaped being shot by the
Belgian sentry.</p>

<p>"Back into the town&mdash;and tout droit," were
his directions. We got back. There seemed no
difficulty about <em>that</em>. We hammered in vain at a
door. Judging by the noise, we succeeded in
arousing every dog in the neighbourhood, but not
a human being came to our rescue. More wild
spurts! Yet it was not until some two hours later
that we found ourselves on a broad road, which
proved to be the right one. But our troubles were
not at an end even then, for the driver, by this
time, was in such a state of exasperation that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
vowed nothing in the world would persuade him to
go farther than Calais. "It's like driving in the
sea!" he grumbled, as in truth it was, for the mud
was literally flowing over the floor of the car, and
our condition was indescribable.</p>

<p>Eventually, by means of much persuasion, not
untinged by bribery, he was prevailed upon to
finish the journey, throughout which he maintained
for the most part a surly silence, interpolated only
by semi-audible remarks about the folly of English
people who <em>would</em> travel in all weathers.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 13th.</i> It is now necessary for every
worker in the hospitals to have a permit. It is
time, too, for many are the rumours of spies who
have crept in and gleaned valuable information
from the wounded.</p>

<p>A word about the position of volunteer workers.
There is no denying that in the early days, before
the staff of the Army hospitals was up to the full
strength required by the extraordinary demands of
modern warfare, they did an immense amount of
good. But a plea must be put in for the central
organisation, which has been effected so wonderfully
by those in charge.</p>

<p>One by one the hospitals run by well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
but little experienced women are vanishing or
coming under War Office control. One by one
free-lance workers brought to the scene of
action by motives of patriotism or curiosity are
being banished to their proper sphere or sent
home.</p>

<p>It is very hard on them, one realises, after they
have given so much, yet, hard though it may be, it
is but one of the lesser evils of war.</p>

<p>The position of those members of the Voluntary
Aid Detachments still here is precarious to the
last degree.</p>

<p>They have been relegated to rest station and
canteen work where, in the disused railway trucks
they have rigged out so well as kitchens and
emergency dressing-rooms, they administer to the
wounded on the trains by day and night, veritable
angels of mercy, as the men say. Yet none of
them is allowed to do hospital work. One cannot
help wondering that the authorities do not utilise
them as probationers under trained nurses instead
of using up the strength of the qualified workers in
menial jobs. But apparently the law out here is
"scrap and discard," which may be a good motto
for Ford cars, but seems somewhat hard on human
beings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 17th.</i> The news of the bombardment
of Scarborough, the wholesale slaughter of
women and children, which has just come through,
must be greatly gratifying to the Germans!</p>

<p>We wonder if it will bring the reality of war
home to the people of England.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 18th.</i> The craving for music, for
something to relieve the tension, is almost unbearable.
Fortunately, the French attitude towards
piano playing has slightly relaxed lately; they no
longer stand agape at the idea of overwrought
nurses enjoying a few simple songs, and we have
been able to hire some well-worn copies of popular
tunes to strum on the exceedingly out-of-tune
piano. What we lack in music we are repaid for
by the picturesqueness of Boulogne. Here stand a
batch of khaki Tommies surrounded by an admiring
group of French children. "Eengleesh soldyer,"
they cry gleefully, clinging to the men's arms and
not to be moved until some souvenir has been
obtained, a button, a hat badge, a cigarette-end.
Along the front, the incessant tramp of feet by
day and night, recruits, young conscripts full of
life and enthusiasm, squads of more sombre men
who have already received their baptism of fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
trams laden with Army and Red Cross nurses, the
former in their ugly red capes so successfully devised
by Florence Nightingale to hide the human
form divine.</p>

<p>The stormy nights, too, are very beautiful,
when one may watch the searchlights catching the
crested waves, until the sea seems alight with a
myriad lightships.</p>

<p>The papers tell us of the appointment of Prince
Hussein Kamel Pasha as Sultan of Egypt. It
seems such a wonderfully clever diplomatic coup
that it drives all thoughts of our surroundings from
our minds.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 19th.</i> <em>Such</em> a pretty kettle of fish!
and one which nothing but a miracle can remedy.
No doubt in every big enterprise there are to be
found unscrupulous men who, in default of a supervising
and restraining hand, will omit to administer
public funds with the same thrift that they would
their own. Thus, in reply to accusations of extravagance
levelled at the Society, the British Red
Cross in Boulogne have decided to retrench. Alas!
that the originators of the scheme have no sense
of humour or justice.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that the nurses are the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
people who are working at anything like full pressure
out here, they have received a notice that
calmly brushes aside the very one-sided six months'
contract under which they came out (for, unlike
the Army Nursing Sisters who, besides their pay,
receive allowances and war gratuities after active
service, sick pay if their health is impaired, and a
pension if disabled, the British Red Cross nurses
agreed to demand no redress if disabled on active
service), to the effect that on January 1st the
Joint War Committee has decided to lower their
fees from &pound;2 2s. to the unprofessional sum of &pound;1,
and those who are not agreeable to this breach of
contract may consider themselves dismissed.</p>

<p>Thus, at the New Year, 300 fully trained
women, most of whom have relinquished highly
responsible positions in order to come out, are faced
with the alternative of accepting barely a living
wage (for &pound;1 minus 7&frac12; per cent. and 10 per cent.
co-operating percentage and minor weekly expenses
is little enough for those who have the future
to consider), or returning home, only to find their
posts filled.</p>

<p>The arguments for this breach of contract are
specious though unconvincing, the reasons given
being:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>1. "A desire to have as much as possible available
for the sick and wounded."</p>

<p>2. "To remove the 'injustice' from the St.
John nurses, who have in the past been receiving
less than one-half the salary paid to other nurses."</p>

<p>But then, why did the authorities draw up a
contract by which the Red Cross refused voluntary
workers, whilst the Order of St. John accepted
gratuitous services from those who could afford to
render them? Yes, both the arguments are excellent;
but one cannot help asking why the small
body of nurses who have spent years in training,
and who are dependent on their earnings, are the
only body to suffer by the new economies, whilst
a number of orderlies continue to draw salaries
higher than those of the qualified nurses. What,
too, of the high salaried officials, of the untrained
dressers, until recently earning &pound;2 per week and
gaining experience in the wards (this experience
being counted in their studies)? Above all, what
of the principle of this breach of contract, the
signing of invalid documents?</p>

<p>But these, after all, are minor details, and one
must survey the work of the British Red Cross
Society <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in toto</i>. The true tale of these mistakes
will never be told, for the blunders of a few individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
will no doubt be wiped away by the memory
of the great achievements of the institution in
equipping hospitals, making good deficiencies in
the regular supplies, and supplementing those supplies
by little luxuries whose absence on a bed of
pain is a real privation.</p>

<p>There is no denying that what the Red Cross
lacks in organisation it makes up for in generosity,
as many a patient could tell, many a hospital
testify; and, all things considered, is it in any way
less well organised than other institutions in this
chaotic zone, in these chaotic times, where only
the unforeseen seems to occur, and where
the duplication of authority is so bewildering
that it is almost an impossibility to lay one's
finger on the man responsible for any particular
department?</p>

<p class="mt2"><i>December 24th.</i> If no one else has benefited
by the war, certainly the Boulogne shopkeepers
cannot complain! Never in the annals of their existence
have they flourished so well. Prices have
been forced up, not only in accordance with the
laws of supply and demand, but for the benefit of
the influx of the rich and influential foreigners,
who consider it beneath their dignity to bargain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a><br />
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a><br />
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
One so often hears officers complaining of how
they are "rooked" out here instead of receiving
the consideration of war prices. It is a pity that,
in a country where bargaining is the order of the
day, and successful bargaining is regarded as an
art to be envied and emulated, we do not view the
matter more broadmindedly, for this ignorance of
racial differences is apt to lead to misunderstanding.</p>

<p>On another score the French have the upper
hand. Why don't we have conscription? they
ask. <em>We</em> wonder too, but the people at home
don't seem to take things seriously.</p>

<p>I had occasion to take down some casks of
oranges to the &mdash;&mdash; Barracks, a kind of auxiliary
convalescent camp, where the "BX," or unfit
men, live in a large concrete island swimming
in the mud. The ambulance man who drove
me groaned and swore vociferously at the number
of whole-skinned youths "swanking" about the
base.</p>

<p>"Why aren't they in the trenches?" he asked.
"On our convoy we've nothing but men who have
been refused for the Army. I've only been in
Boulogne six hours (he was going on leave), and
I'm disgusted with it all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 26th.</i> Christmas Day dawned the
coldest, whitest Christmas anyone could wish for.
The little church was packed for morning service,
in spite of the fact that most of us had been to
midnight mass at St. Nicholas, a service more noteworthy
for the crowded congregation who surge
unceasingly in their efforts to get to the fore than
for any particular beauty or fervour.</p>

<p>All the afternoon we worked hard at concerts
in the hospital and soldiers' institute, where I acted
as accompanist. No doubt one day we shall grow
accustomed to war, but I own that the crowded
wards of the vast barn of men (whose hearty applause
and cheery choruses covered the deficiencies
of the performance), the uniforms, the white caps,
the cheerfulness born of the determination to make
the best of the abnormal circumstances, struck me
as a never-to-be-forgotten thing. And in every
hospital it is the same.</p>

<p>The men are all hung like Christmas trees with
their presents, which they treasure as mementoes
of this memorable year. Nor have the nurses been
forgotten, and the little fur-lined cape sent to each
one by H.M. Queen Alexandra is a gift that could
not be bettered; for it is bitterly cold, with the
damp cold that is a far greater tax upon one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
powers of endurance than a crisp frost, and furs are
a great luxury, as all the men glorying in their
new sheepskin coats can testify.</p>

<p>It was not till nearly nine that our work ceased
and we got any dinner at all, the midday meal
having been cut out for a rehearsal.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 29th.</i> It was very impressive, the
Seymour Hicks concert, to which some twenty of
us were bidden. It took place in a large shed on
the Quai du Bassin, which a pile of empty baskets
and an occasional turnip prove to have been a
vegetable market in other days.</p>

<p>The stage, built up of a stack of trestle tables,
was ornamented with flags.</p>

<p>Looking round from our front seats at the
2,000 eager faces behind, there was a feeling of
awe in our hearts as we realised how much devolved
on us as representatives of our countrywomen out
here.</p>

<p>Rain and hail beat down. The performance
began. To our unaccustomed ears it was like a
dream.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, an extra gust brought down the
light wire and we were in blackness. The C.O.
shouted that no men were to leave their seats, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the pianist played some of their own songs, to
which they sang. Oh, how they sang, their deep
voices threatening to bring the roof off!</p>

<p>In after years it will be interesting to note the
music of 1914, the rise and wane of "Tipperary"
and "Sister Susie" and a hundred other popular
songs that have made life cheery for our warriors.</p>

<p>By the light of two carriage lamps the performance
was finished, and, as we filed out, the
men pressed forward to shake hands with nurses
and artists indiscriminately, with a "Thank 'ee
kindly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>What a night! Hail and wind, thunder and
rain, rockets and guns, the beat, beat, beat on the
panes, the howling, the whistling of the wind, the
clouds scurrying across the sky, the incessant noise
without, the awful cold within. Above my bed the
ceiling has nearly fallen in, whilst buckets act as
receptacles for the rain in no fewer than three
places. And dare we complain, whilst our men
are in the trenches? Never!</p>

<p>The success of the concert makes one realise
the tension at which we are living, makes one wish
that something could be done to relieve it&mdash;a
cinema opened, weekly concerts, etc., organised
for the benefit of those who are working, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
for the wounded, in order to make life more
normal.</p>

<p>After all, it is as injurious to live at this highly
strung pitch as it is to exist on a grey level, and
"Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we
die" is not the spirit that makes for endurance in
war or peace.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 31st.</i> A miracle <em>has</em> occurred, for
the protest lodged by the Red Cross nurses has
been heard, a compromise arrived at by which the
original contract is to be fulfilled. Let their stand,
which was not effected without much determination
and hard work on the part of the leaders, be
recorded as one of the first women's trade unions.</p>

<p>So ends 1914. God grant that the New Year
may bring us Peace, or, if not Peace, the strength
to play our parts in the great game worthily of our
men!</p>

things out here that we are apt to ignore the larger
issues altogether.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;even as, looking back at bygone years,
it is the little things that count&mdash;the branch that
taps against the study window, the sickly scent of
lime trees, the odd pattern on the nursery cup,
the wind across the fields, the broken doll, so is
it by little things alone that we can draw true
pictures of our own times.</p>

<p>The days have been too busy collecting
"woollies" for those who need them, getting together
a library for the "BX" men, writing
letters for the wounded, to keep my diary.</p>

<p>There is much humour as well as pathos in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
letters that are dictated, and hackneyed phrases,
such as "Hoping this finds you as it leaves me"
and "I take up the pen to tell you," recur frequently,
often with ambiguous meanings.</p>

<p>"Dear Wife,&mdash;You will be glad to hear that
I have lost an arm, but am still alive and hope
to be home with you soon. Hoping this finds you
as it leaves me, Yours Truly, A. S.," ran one
I took down to-day.</p>

<p>One is reminded of the anecdote of the man
who, when asked if he had ever been in love, replied:
"In love? Of course, my dear sir, on
many occasions, and each time with the same unswerving
devotion," when, as is not infrequently
the case, one man contrives to keep up an apparently
parallel correspondence with that portion of
the community whom he designates as his "Lidy
friends," and, equally oblivious of amanuensis and
censor, dispatches missives, identical in expressions
of passionate devotion, to each of the respective
recipients. Romance, too, ripens quickly out
here, and each of the aforementioned five happy
damsels who was "My dear Miss X" a week ago
becomes "My darling sweetheart" to-day. One
wonders what will happen to the remaining four
when, in due course, the returning hero decides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
upon which of the unsuspecting maidens to bestow
his comprehensive heart!</p>

<p>One day I went over to see some friends at
Calais, where they are leading the same gendarme-hunted
life as the Dunkirk journalist, in order to
be near their Belgian fianc&eacute;s. Every three days
they have to change their quarters, and though it
is only a fortnight ago that I received their invitation,
it was only after inquiring at four hotels
that I ran them to earth.</p>

<p>Calais is feeling very thrilled at her own importance,
for the enemy are bombing her with a
vigour that marks her as a foe worthy of attention.</p>

<p>The attitude of the French towards the Belgians,
whose headquarters lie here, is less enthusiastic
than ours; indeed, one might safely say it is
one of mistrust. England opened her arms not to
the true Belgians alone, that little gallant army
to whose valour we owe so much, but, for their
sake, indiscriminately to the hordes of German
spies who came over with the first influx of
refugees, to the dregs of humanity who were let
loose when the cosmopolitan prison doors were
thrown open.</p>

<p>France was wiser. Hospitality, she said, is all
very well, but <em>first</em> of all we will sift our guests and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
discover which of them are deserving. And sifting
them she is, allotting them freedom in their own
sphere, but not freedom to circulate in the zone of
other armies. Not that France for a moment
belittles or undervalues the achievement of that
valiant little country or its heroic King, but she
realises&mdash;as do most Belgians themselves&mdash;the
danger attendant upon this promiscuous harbouring
of unregistered adults whose political leanings
may be entirely alien.</p>

<p>In due course, no doubt, when our paroxysm
of Belgian mania dies, we too shall come to see
the wisdom of this measure.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 9th.</i> We are now beginning to receive
Christmas packages sent out from home some six
weeks back, which, owing to lack of sorters to
attend to them, have been held up at Havre.
Hitherto, the postal arrangements have been most
primitive and as surprising as they were vague.
Some letters and packages would arrive by the
French post, some via the Red Cross service, and
yet others by the military mail from Havre. A
missive might take anything from three days to
four weeks on its way from home.</p>

<p>But now we are less cut off from civilisation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and not only letters but papers as well arrive
regularly; and perhaps the most welcome sound
of the day is the newsboys' cry as they run along
the quay or dart into hotels and hospitals with
lightning-like rapidity, heralding their arrival
with shouts of "<cite>Dailee Mai-il! Mirreure!
Times!</cite>"</p>

<p>To-day Major X&mdash;&mdash; asked me to run a
canteen for his men, whose lot, too far from
the town to be able to enjoy the shops, is far
from enviable. True to the principle of doing
<em>anything</em> that is needed, I am off home to get
the stores together.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 14th.</i> The five days' "furlough"
have passed as a dream, and it was with a sigh of
infinite relief that I stepped once more on to
French soil.</p>

<p>The extraordinary "let's-muddle-along-it-can't-last-for-ever"
attitude at home is distinctly
depressing, and the fact that half of the
people are quite content to let others do their job
whilst they look on with an amused smile and reap
the benefit of the shortage of men makes one long
to see them well "strafed."</p>

<p>As I sat in the theatre beside an old friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
now an enthusiastic captain in K.'s Army, and
thought how soon the brave fellow would be facing
the Reality of what he enjoys now so thoroughly
as a Theory, and listened to the cheap patriotism
of the show, it seemed the cheaper for the lack of
action.</p>

<p>Why, after all, should our beautiful island be
left with the unfit, the loafers, the "funks" as
fathers for the future generations? In every other
country the army is representative, not of the pick
of the land, but of the average male population.
We, however, seem bent on committing race
suicide.</p>

<p>But as the old familiar quay hove in sight my
spirits rose. Here, after all, lies work that must
be done. It is the Real Thing.</p>

<p>If my leave has been short it has been pregnant
with interest. The personal side centred itself on
the lost trunk, containing all my worldly possessions
in the way of wearing apparel, which was
sent out in November and has failed to arrive.
Scotland Yard have traced it as far as Boulogne,
they say. I drew their attention to the wonderful
No Man's Land that reigns where all luggage is
dumped on the quay.</p>

<p>Once off the boat the English liability ceases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and so, as the French will take no responsibility,
the goods lie there until someone, usually <em>not</em> the
rightful owner, helps himself.</p>

<p>Thus when a box addressed: "Captain Y&mdash;&mdash;,
Xth Regiment&mdash;Fur Coat&mdash;to be delivered immediately,"
that has lain for three weeks in the rain,
disappears at <em>last</em>, one may be quite safe in assuming
that the same fur coat will be fetching a good
price on the Paris market a few days hence.</p>

<p>The second and more important interest is the
canteen.</p>

<p>Just as the control of all cars and hospitals
has been now taken over definitely by the War
Office, surely even so small a thing as canteen
work should all be under one organisation. The
Y.M.C.A., it appears, have a recreation hut for
the men at the convalescent camp and a big hut
on the quay.</p>

<p>To the Y.M.C.A., then, let our energies be
dedicated! For they are a coming factor in
the scheme of things, and individual enterprise,
gratifying and profitable though it may be to the
individual, is hardly <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro bono publico</i>.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 15th.</i> There are hours when one
would love a little solitude&mdash;the solitude that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
after all, as necessary for well-being as food and
rest; hours when the time to digest and sift the
manifold occurrences of the day, the presence of
a congenial friend to replace the many acquaintances
with whom circumstances have herded us
together, and a browse over a favourite poet, would
be very welcome. Yet, in truth, poetry no longer
matters, art no longer matters, music no longer
matters to most of us; nothing <em>really</em> matters save
life and death and the end of this carnage. Nor
will the old r&eacute;gime, the old art, the old literature
ever again satisfy those who have seen red and
faced life shorn of its trappings of superficiality
and conventions. Yet in spite of the fact that all
around us we see butchery and the degrading
results of Germany's peculiar <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">kultur</i>, in spite of
the fact that the spiritual side of life has been&mdash;is
still&mdash;so utterly dormant as to be almost a thing
of another existence, on the whole an attitude of
great enthusiasm and gratitude prevails for the
privilege of being able to work.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 18th.</i> My first glimpse at a canteen!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i139">
<img src="images/i139.jpg" width="600" height="333" alt="THE FIRST HUT AT THE BASE" />
<span class="caption">THE FIRST HUT AT THE BASE</span>
</a></div>

<p>Let me describe the scene as we entered to
find a long queue of shivering Tommies waiting.
The long "hut," at the end of which, on a platform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a><br />
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a><br />
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the piano tinkles incessantly, seemed smaller
by reason of the many chairs and forms.</p>

<p>The counter, on the clearing of which our
attention was turned first, like the tables, is
covered with red-and-white check oilcloth, which
facilitates the swabbing up of the ever crowded
place.</p>

<p>Behind the counter are tables, on which, in
between serving the men, we busy ourselves with
the preparation of cocoa, the cutting up of cakes
and bread, an occupation which I discover to be
as much a science as an art.</p>

<p>In the little kitchen the great struggle is to
get water boiling in time, and to keep it boiling,
in response to the demand. The difficulty at the
counter is to keep tea and coffee hot without
letting them stew. At one end we take it in turns
to take money and to dole out tickets, which are
exchanged for goods at the counter. The advantages
of the ticket system are mostly noticeable
during a "rush," when it diverts the stream of
men and obviates the necessity of serving food
with coin-soiled hands.</p>

<p>One must, it seems, keep as little as possible
on the counter, for fear of tempting Providence
and the impecunious! But a wonderful medley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of tobacco, soap, bootlaces, chocolate, etc., is
displayed on shelves at the back.</p>

<p>Here the men can write home on paper supplied
free by the Y.M.C.A. (A big notice on the wall
reminds them to "Write home now.") They can
read (a small library, which my fingers are itching
to catalogue, lies at the end of the building); they
can bank here, and play games, and get advice on
all problems, mental and moral.</p>

<p>The value of the work can best be estimated
by the men's appreciation of it in their letters
home, their continual inquiries after similar institutions
"up the line," their sorrow when they
hear: "No, we're not up there yet&mdash;but shall be
soon."</p>

<p>The workers consist of Y.M.C.A. secretaries,
mostly Nonconformist ministers, and volunteer
ladies who wander on duty when the spirit moves
them, which sometimes necessitates one shift going
without its meals.</p>

<p>A pleasant little music teacher, who is spending
her holiday out here, and is useful for
organising concerts, accompanying the men, etc.,
initiated me into the work. The rest of the
"staff" consists of a French girl, to cook the
secretaries' meals, and a half-witted man, supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to tend the fires, help with the washing up, etc.,
but who is invariably inspired to play hymns just
when most needed.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 25th.</i> A naval battle off the Dogger
Bank is reported, which reminds me of the letters
I receive from a naval friend, whose life on board
the &mdash;&mdash; is spent patrolling the North Sea and
longing for action. How different from the fighting
friends one runs into occasionally! The other
day I came across one who was down with a touch
of tonsilitis, having passed through Mons and
every big battle that succeeded it unscathed. "I
shouldn't at all mind going home with a smashed
arm!" he remarked with an almost involuntary
sigh, gazing wistfully at the hospital ship as she
sailed majestically out of harbour, her gleaming
red cross casting weird lights on the dark
water.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 28th.</i> There are times when one is
unkind enough to wish one's co-workers the discipline
of three months as junior probationer in a
large hospital. Last night I arrived to find myself
the only worker, and although I enjoyed the rush
right enough, it was impossible to get things done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to time, and many of the men had to go away
unserved.</p>

<p>The methylated spirit ran out, and so demobilised
the services of the Primus stoves. The secretary
had a bad headache, and was therefore only
able to sit at the till, and the odd man was inspired
to make night hideous with his discordant hymns,
and, having had a tiff with one of the ladies earlier
in the day, refused to do a stroke of work. It was
a particularly busy night, never less than a hundred
men in the hut, I should say, and ten o'clock
found me still washing up cups with the aid of a
little chauffeur whose vehicle had gone wrong!
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Faute de mieux</i> he accompanied me along the
roughest part of the quay, where one is apt to be
molested by the drunken navvies who reel about
at night.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 30th.</i> Wish hard enough and it shall
be given unto you! Yesterday was a day of joy,
for in it I found a real girl friend of my own age
and kind.</p>

<p>She appeared on the scene one morning like a
breath of fresh air, this young American.</p>

<p>"What are <em>you</em> doing over here?" I asked.
"Come to see the war?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guess you're about right," she replied, with
an accent you could cut with a knife. "Nothing
else would have dragged me away from God's own
country!"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 31st.</i> The old order changeth&mdash;even
in Boulogne! In less than a week the Red Cross
will be installed at the C&mdash;&mdash;, where once was the
Allied Forces Base Hospital. In less than a week
all Red Cross cars come under direct supervision
of the A.S.C.</p>

<p>To-day the Red Cross sisters at the Gare
Maritime (No. &mdash;&mdash; Stationary Hospital) have
received their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cong&eacute;</i>, even those "original six"
who built it up, being superseded by Army nurses.</p>

<p>Most of the nurses I know have dispersed,
many to St. Omer, where in a big monastery
hospital they are stamping out enteric amongst
the civilian population in order to safeguard our
men. Miss A&mdash;&mdash; has gone to L&mdash;&mdash;, where, from
Dr. Le Page's hospital, she writes of wonderful
surgical work.</p>

<p>I too would be glad of a new sphere of action,
for I am lost in amazement at the sea of petty
jealousies. Where is the unity of purpose that
bound us all together in the beginning? Is disunion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the outcome of overwrought nerves? Even
at the hut discord reigns.</p>

<p>The lady in charge dislikes both the music
teacher and the American girl, who in turn live
at daggers drawn with the respective people of
their respective parties and are envious of
each other. And yet they one and all are
extremely nice folk. One must attribute it to
some especially puissant sprite and to Pandora's
carelessness!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<small>February, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>February 2nd.</i> This morning, in company
with our chief, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, I went over to prospect
in the new sphere of action. The lower
part of the hotel that the Association has taken is
devoted to a canteen, whilst on the first floor there
is a library and writing-room, and above, seven
spacious rooms lie empty until such a time as the
hostel is started. The hostel is a grand scheme for
billeting gratis the relatives of badly wounded men,
who could otherwise not afford the journey.</p>

<p>My heart sank at sight of the minute kitchen,
the range of which seemed literally hidden by pots
and pans; but no doubt one day we shall get it in
order.</p>

<p>The secretary&mdash;a Scottish padre&mdash;is full of
enthusiasm for football, with which he hopes to
keep the men at the base well amused.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, on exploring for myself, I
discovered that the most interesting feature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
place is the isolation compound that lies alongside
the enteric hospital. Here all infectious illnesses
are treated in bathing-boxes rigged out as
wards; here are patients indulging in every conceivable
disease, from mumps and measles
to diphtheria, typhoid and the dreaded spinal
meningitis.</p>

<p>Farther along, attached to the Casino, whose
spacious gaming rooms make wonderfully cheerful
wards, is a smaller hotel, where the men suffering
from skin diseases are treated. One's heart goes
out to these men, especially the wounded ones,
who through no fault of their own are afflicted
with the foul diseases that follow in the train of
war.</p>

<p>The main road is lined with hospitals&mdash;the
"British," the "Anglo-American," the "Rawal
Pindi" (so called because the unit was mobilised
in that far-away Indian station), and others.</p>

<p>The great objection to the converted hotels is
the smallness of the well-appointed rooms, which
gives one the desire to knock down intervening
walls and form them into one spacious room to
save the sisters' feet and the patients' voices!</p>

<p>One is lost in admiration now at the organisation
of things, just as two months ago one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
appalled by the state of unreadiness. Nothing
that can be done for our men is omitted.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>February 3rd.</i> For the last time I watch the
moon wane, the sun rise over the mist-bathed
harbour. Will the picture I have learned to love
so well ever fade? The countless masts rising to
the sky, the water dashing over the distant breakwater,
the clock at the Gare Maritime, now visible,
now obscured by smoke from the packet-boat's
funnel.</p>

<p>The incoming destroyers, the sister hospital
ships lying abreast, the distant windmill on the
hill, round which many corrugated iron buildings
are springing up (bakeries, they say), the weather-beaten
tars, the women, their backs bent with the
weight of their sacks of mussels and cockles, tramping
along barefooted or in sabots, the ceaseless
stream of ambulances.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>February 8th.</i> Laden with parting gifts and
consoled by parting regrets (strangest among
them those of our padre, who will miss having
someone to darn his socks!), we found ourselves
at our new domain&mdash;the American girl and I.</p>

<p>Certainly the circumstances of our arrival were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
far from favourable, for my colleague fell very
ill the day we arrived, and after a night spent
on the floor of her ten-by-eight-feet-long room
(oh, those boards!&mdash;my bones still ache, my
head swims in memory of them), we installed
her in a military hospital, and set to work to
"carry on."</p>

<p>Two other workers have arrived from England;
neither of them having done hard manual labour
before, they are apt to find this somewhat
strenuous, though to our more veteran hands it is
child's play. Footsoreness, too, that bane of all
amateur workers, is their portion.</p>

<p>There are times when one wonders if all new
things are horrid!</p>

<p>This morning, at Mattins in the little tin
church, for instance, when the convalescent soldier
organist, with the angelic face and absolute lack of
any musical instinct, crashed out his last discordant
notes, when the congregation, consisting of three
nurses, the old, old man who took round the plate,
and two maiden ladies who acted as choir, trooped
into the sunshine, I could not but cast a longing
thought at St. John's, with its dim religious glow
and mellow organ and congregation of muddy
soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>February 12th.</i> Besides getting the place in
order, we are busily employed in thinking out new
dishes for the men. To the ordinary store of cakes
and drinks we have already added custard, stewed
fruits, and bread puddings.</p>

<p>In spare moments I catalogue the library, and
have evolved a good system by which the men fill
in the register themselves on taking out a book,
thus dispensing with a librarian. The library book
is like this:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Library book">

</table>
</div>

<p class="mt2"><i>February 16th.</i> Yesterday, a train being derailed
close by here on its way up to the front,
and the men left stranded, we took them up a
supply of cigarettes and chocolates that good
friends at home had sent out.</p>

<p>The canteen is growing like wildfire, and we
are heart and soul in our work, which we estimate
by the material return in the till each evening.
We have trebled the receipts in two weeks, which
shows how the men are flocking to it.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>February 18th.</i> <em>The day</em>&mdash;the great day of
the German blockade. We are wondering how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
far the enemy will really carry out his scheme.
Certainly no mail boat has come in to-day, and we
are without letters or newspapers. The suspension
of communication with England is nothing
new, but we are speculating if this time it will
be a matter of weeks instead of days.</p>

<p>Being <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i> with a sore throat&mdash;the
toll exacted apparently by this germ-filled place
from every worker who comes to stay&mdash;I have
leisure to note our surroundings. The walls of the
large, airy room, which though devoid of all save
the necessities of life is luxury embodied by reason
of its cleanliness, are bare except for a few unpaid
bills held together by a file, a few hastily scrawled
quotations from favourite authors to remind us
that we once had time to indulge in beautiful
pictures, to roam into the realms of beautiful
books.</p>

<p>By the window, acting as a couch, are two large
wooden cases in which gramophones for the men
had been sent out, and which prove a great attraction
to the friendly little mice who come out and
hold long confabulations, not only under cover of
night, but frequently, when things are quiet, by
day. They are welcome enough to the wooden
boxes, but when they take to running over our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
beds, our clothing as it lies on the chairs, and
finally even over our <em>faces</em>, they can hardly expect
to be well received!</p>

<p>The view from the window is superb. Before
us, in front of the little grey church, the river
runs down to the sea, now gently, now turbulently.
To the right a peep of the ocean. To the left
the bridge, through the arches of which is a
glimpse of landscape as peaceful as any Tuscan
village, and over which the trains pass <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'intermittingly'">intermittently</ins>
up to the front by day and by night.
They rush past with a whistle that is more of a
shriek and a groan, as if they themselves realised
the value of their burden&mdash;the guns, the ammunition
wagons, the trainloads of men in khaki or
in blue clustered along the edge of the overcrowded
trucks designed to carry "eighteen horses or
thirty-six men."</p>

<p>In contrast with the rushing up-trains the
loaded ambulances crawl creakingly down at a
snail's pace.</p>

<p>God! That such things should be! If the
heart of the world were big enough, surely it
would break at so much misery, so much destruction.
For what have all previous generations
laboured, legislating, studying to salve human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
ills? For this! Wanton destruction, rapine,
murder.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>February 21st.</i> These are exciting times.
Last night there was the sound of guns at sea.
An engagement off Dover is recounted, but papers
no longer get through to us. A sudden explosion
about five o'clock the same day, and the subsequent
report of a sunken hospital ship, afterwards
said to have been a neutral (Dutch?) liner, leaves
us with but the vaguest idea of what really
happened.</p>

<p>Just as the doctor, a kindly little man, who
was invalided down some weeks ago from his field
ambulance at B&mdash;&mdash;, had appeared, stethoscope
in hand, all attention was riveted on a funeral that
passed by&mdash;that of a nursing sister who has just
died of the fatal spotted fever. The flower-bedecked
coffin, the whole available hospital unit
marching slowly with arms reversed, made an
impressive sight. One wondered if she had ever
received so much attention in her lifetime as at
her death. The doctor told me that in India,
where the intense heat is sometimes conducive to
suicide, the fear of <em>not</em> having a military funeral
often acts as a deterrent.</p>

<p>No sooner was the cort&egrave;ge past than a broken
aeroplane rolled by on a heavy trolley, and left us
wondering if that was the crash we heard yesterday.</p>

<p>An air raid on Calais, packet-boat nearly sunk,
torpedoes off Boulogne&mdash;it almost seems as if we
are going to see the real thing.</p>

<p>Martial law here has become very strict. The
roads are guarded so that one cannot move an inch
without showing passports. Lights have to be
out by 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and even my diary has to be penned
behind a screen of bedclothes with the aid of a
candle stump. Seeing that we only finish work
at 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, have to get home, eat our supper, and
go to bed in the dark, it is rather tiresome, and
we are now engaged in rigging up light-proof
curtains.</p>

<p>On returning to work after my first committee
meeting&mdash;the very existence of which proves the
method that is creeping into the erstwhile chaos&mdash;I
was greeted by the news of our Dardanelles
Expedition which is now occupying all our attention.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<small>March, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>March 5th.</i> March was inaugurated by an
amusing incident. At about midnight the alarm
was given&mdash;a Taube or Zeppelin signalled from
Calais&mdash;bells rang, guns boomed, the whole of
the French population turned out, and the police
raided a nurse's room because a light was visible&mdash;and,
after all, nothing happened.</p>

<p>That the Germans still have hopes of getting
to Calais is obvious from their Press comments on
the range of their coast guns.</p>

<p>"The chief point of which lies in the suggestion
that from Calais the harbour defences of Dover
can be bombarded over a front of five and a half
miles!" (See extract from <cite>Daily Mail</cite>.) Their
preparations for billeting a number of troops in
Belgium are large: "At Li&eacute;ge 20,000 men are
expected." The order has been given for the
Wimereux hospitals to be cleared.</p>

<p>"It is our duty to keep the men here and feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the front," said one of the C.O.s to-day. "And
when we are told to clear it means a big move."</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 10th.</i> In spite of the fact that a great
battle is raging at Neuve Chapelle, where the
British have made a great push, the "all star"
concert party, sent over by the Y.M.C.A. in
London, gave a performance in the large gaming
room of the Casino (once the haunt of so much
frivolity). The worst cases lay in beds in the
centre, whilst the blue-jacketed lesser cases
clustered behind, and the sisters flitted to and fro
in their grey dresses and red capes attending to the
more serious.</p>

<p>"Messieurs, faites vos jeux, le jeu est fait!"
Over and over again the suave voice of the croupier
seemed to ring in my ears&mdash;as it had so often rung
in this very room in peace time. "Faites vos
jeux." What an awful thing this new game of
War is, only those who have seen can grasp.</p>

<p>"Le jeu est fait!"&mdash;and here in this gilded
hall, that once witnessed such a different game,
we see the results.</p>

<p>Stretchers were brought in all through the
performance. As I glanced up during the cheerful
chorus of "Here we are&mdash;here we are&mdash;here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
we are again!" a man was borne in with his eyes
blown out. He lay very still, as if the unaccustomedness
of it was yet upon him. The tears
blinded me. Then he too began to sing.</p>

<p>The spirits of the men are wonderful. "It's
worth losing a limb to live through a victory!"
they say.</p>

<p>When our work was over we left the close,
smoke-choked room (and it is wonderful how
soldiers who have had a sufficiency of open-air
life seem to revel in closed doors and windows!)
for a short stroll. It was a still, foreboding night.
The barriers were well guarded, darkness reigned
over the town, and as we strolled along the rough
road our path was lighted only by the passing
ambulances, whilst across the lowering heavy
heavens played the searchlights.</p>

<p>Ambulance after ambulance passed, a few
going fast, most, alas! at the slow, cautious speed
that betokens the worst.</p>

<p>What untold misery these crushed bits of
humanity mean, borne swiftly to the silent city
of suffering! How gladly we would suffer for
them! Yet not a moan, not a groan, in those
great wards whilst mind and will have power to
cope with the agonies of the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 12th.</i> We heard interesting anecdotes
of our fighters at Christmas-time from an important
man on the court martial. One private, under
cover of festivities, slipped down to the base, where
for some months he has lived in style on French
bounty as an officer of the Guards! Another man,
an N.C.O. employed in office work, was told off
to write out notices forbidding the men overburdened
with Christmas gifts to return things
home, as they have been doing. He handed in
the documents, and with them a big parcel to be
censored, which when opened was found to contain
a quantity of socks, bearing the legend:
"These may come in useful."</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 13th.</i> Soup is the latest addition to our
bill of fare for the men, who greatly appreciate it
as being more nourishing than tea.</p>

<p>Our battle with Primus stoves is never-ending.
The roar of these little indispensable instruments
of torture haunts us, and an effigy of one will
assuredly be engraven on some of our tombstones!
Apropos of food, we have grown almost
into vegetarians, the meat we get being mostly
horse&mdash;which, dressed in the delightfully piquant
French style, is tasty but not nourishing&mdash;or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
eternal pork that occurs and recurs with clockwork
regularity alternately disguised as veal, lamb or
mutton.</p>

<p>There are days when we envy the men&mdash;whose
rations of good bully beef they affect to scorn&mdash;with
all our hearts.</p>

<p>The spring push continues. The rapidity with
which the Neuve Chapelle men were brought
down to the base, often finding themselves
in hospital twelve hours after they fell, is
incredible.</p>

<p>Last night a Red Cross ambulance driver, who
had passed through before, came in for some
coffee. As he counted his change I noted his eyes
were dim with unshed tears. When he confessed
that the strain of many sleepless nights is beginning
to tell on him, I could find few words of
comfort.</p>

<p>The awful groans, the prayers for release as
he drives along the jolting roads, petrify him. And
these last days have been pregnant with work for
the ambulances. The culminating point was
reached to-night, when, the car breaking down
on a lonely road, he stepped round to find out
how his men were, and discovered that of four
only one still lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 18th.</i> To-day the news came that the
hostel is to be officially opened. From the batch
of War Office correspondence with which I am
now inundated I glean:</p>

<p>1. "Arrangements have now been made to
send to France at the public expense a limited
number of relatives of soldiers reported to be in
a very serious condition in the Base Hospitals."</p>

<p>2. "The number will be limited to six persons
at each of the Bases and to one relative in the case
of each soldier, the accommodation being provided
by the Y.M.C.A., and visits will only be allowed
in cases in which the Medical Officer considers that
the patient would benefit by the presence of a
relation."</p>

<p>The rest of the documents relate to the laws
that govern the free passage, and the certificates
to the effect that the relative is unable to pay
necessary expenses required before passage is
granted, every emergency being admirably prepared
for.</p>

<p>Walking out after some necessary shopping, I
noticed how the Wimereux road has changed&mdash;is
changing. Often during the winter months we
tramped along in the blinding rain wondering at
the loneliness of it all, meeting none but pickets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
at the barricades, the storm-swept roads lighted
every twenty minutes by a passing tram!</p>

<p>And now? Spring is beginning to show in
every cranny. The few trees are bursting with
buds. The road is one incessant rush of cars. The
once sleepy-looking fort, with its visible guns
facing the sea, booms an occasional shot across the
bows of a defaulting vessel, and French soldiers
man&oelig;uvre on the cliffs.</p>

<p>It seems as if spring had put life into everything.
To the left a camp hospital is springing up,
and khaki figures toil away with ropes and canvas.
To the right, by the sea, walls of earth are being
thrown up that look like trenches, but are in reality
drains.</p>

<p>Even the men from the trenches are full of
the dramatic contrasts of warfare in spring&mdash;the
song of the lark or nightingale interrupted by the
bursting of the "Jack Johnsons"; the burned
trees and sprouting buds. They tell us, too, most
extraordinary tales of women being found in the
German trenches we have recently gained: some
maintain they were French civilian prisoners;
others that they were the wives of some of the
front-trench Huns. At any rate, the extraordinary
fact remains that they really <em>were</em> there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 19th.</i> With the aid of a fatigue party
of R.A.M.C. men I succeeded in getting the
upstairs rooms of our place into a semblance of
order. The French staff, too, were invaluable,
nothing being too much trouble for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pauvres
bless&eacute;s</i>. Anxieties never <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'some'">come</ins> singly, and to-day
proved our heaviest day owing to an influx of
Canadians and an army of navvies in Government
employment. No sooner were things straight
than in came our first two "wounded relatives"&mdash;as
we have decided to dub our guests. Weary,
dazed, helpless as children, there was nothing to
do but find them some hot supper and get them
to bed, with promises of conducting them to the
hospital the first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>There being no cupboards in the hostel, we
have set to work to make them out of old
packing-cases, and with the remnants of our curtains
and old tablecloths we find them to be, if
not beautiful, quite as serviceable as could be
expected.</p>

<p>One difficulty we cannot overcome is the
odour from the cesspool that forms our drainage
system, and makes one of the valuable
rooms quite untenantable and another hardly
aromatic!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 21st.</i> On our way home last night we
paused a moment to look at the sky.</p>

<p>Gazing from the bridge into the water, it
seemed a very Paradise. Every little star was
reflected in the river, and a yellow crescent moon
rode low in the heavens. No sound save the
murmur of the sea. Suddenly there fell upon our
ears the strains of a mandoline in the distance that
transported us of a sudden to the sunny shores of
the Adriatic.</p>

<p>Our delay might have cost us dear, for on our
arrival home my attic was on fire, some clothing
that my companion had put on the stove pipes
to air having caught, smouldered, and set light to
linoleum and woodwork. Another ten minutes
and nothing could have saved this jerry-built
wooden villa. It was dawn before we slept, and,
needless to remark, I feel like a kipper to-day, the
smell of the smoke is so strong; or some amphibious
animal, for the floor is inundated with water.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 23rd.</i> The news of victories and losses
in the outside world affects us greatly, and the fall
of Przemysl to the Russians has had a very good
effect on our spirits.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we are growing accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
alarms. We have so many Zeppelin scares that
they begin to be of no interest. A horn is
sounded. The French sentries on the bridge
grow seemingly agitated; the French guard turn
out. Groups of people stand gazing Calais-wards
into the sky. An aeroplane comes over&mdash;scouting&mdash;and
that is all.</p>

<p>Apparently, however, the biplane that passed
so close that it seemed almost on top of our
balcony yesterday, was one of those which dropped
bombs on Dover! Our first conscious sight of hostile
craft, this, though we saw something strangely
resembling a periscope on the glassy waters.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 26th.</i> A strange little tragedy is being
enacted in our kitchen. Our landlady's husband
was reported "missing," and whilst she was gone
in search of further information a neighbour, who
had been fighting by his side, came in to confirm
the worst fears. He was killed by a sniper, we
were told, after only one month in the trenches;
and but yesterday the poor little woman was
spending one franc fifty to send him a fourpenny
piece of sausage.</p>

<p>She came in happily content, having learned
no particulars, talking cheerfully of the now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
fashionable khaki uniforms the women are adopting,
and the weeping figures in the kitchen pulled
themselves together and pretended nothing had
occurred.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 29th.</i> When the news was broken they
feared for her reason. For the last three days she
has lain foodless and sleepless, hugging the portrait
of her husband to her heart, sorting out his old
letters, whilst groups of weeping, cr&ecirc;pe-swathed
friends throng the stuffy, unventilated room.</p>

<p>The Boulogne regiment, it seems, has had a
bad cutting-up. Hardly a woman who is not a
widow now. "Mort pour la patrie!" they cry
sadly&mdash;"et apr&egrave;s la guerre?"</p>

<p>To us any condition of "apr&egrave;s la guerre"
has become unthinkable. Sometimes it seems it
must be the end of the world.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>March 30th.</i> According to the local customs,
Madame will not leave the house until the news
of her husband's death has been officially announced
by the Mayor. Thus any shopping
expeditions in quest of the mourning which
engrosses her whole attention have to be made
surreptitiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The official news may be a long time in coming&mdash;weeks,
perhaps months&mdash;nevertheless, until she
has, with the calm resignation demanded by the
occasion, received the official confirmation of the
news, she will not show her face out of doors.
We all pray the ceremony may be soon over, for
surely nothing could be worse for a mourner than
an uninterrupted brooding over pots and pans in
a hot or crowded kitchen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<small>April, 1915</small></h2>


<p class="mt2"><i>April 1st.</i> In spite of the difficulties of getting
teams together, the football league has flourished,
and to-day we had the great final match between
Australians and the A.S.C., for which, at a few
hours' notice, aided by a solitary car, we managed
to give a fairly successful tea.</p>

<p>Thanks to the football and the various other
"tournaments," the canteen is becoming quite an
important factor of the little colony out here. We
find that draught, chess and billiard tournaments
draw the men (who are apt to be "cliquy" and
shy of each other) together more than anything
else, whilst French lessons&mdash;held by a poor little
Belgian soldier, himself far from fluent in the
language&mdash;prove a tremendous attraction, and
serve the additional purpose of adding a moiety
to his minute income.</p>

<p>We have moved on to the premises in order
to be better able to attend to our "relatives,"
as they have a way of turning up at ten at night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
quite exhausted with the novelty of their experience.
To be honest, the interest of their journey
seems to a great extent to mitigate the bitterness
of their loss or the sadness of their visit.</p>

<p>"Law bless us, Miss, what a lot we shall 'ave
to tell 'em at 'ome, which we shouldn't 'ave 'ad
if our dear Bill 'adn't died for 'is country!" said
a Manchester washerwoman to-day.</p>

<p>We are a strange party at meals, for most of
them have never seen a tablecloth nor slept
between sheets before, and their wonderment can
be well gauged.</p>

<p>It is surprising how often one comes across
Nature's gentlemen; one is ashamed at not having
had time to see them in ordinary life. A cab-driver
from "Edinbury" is here to-day, who, in
spite of the fact that he had never before been
outside his native town, has manners that would
grace a king.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>April 8th.</i> One is not always fortunate in
one's companions out here, but, having no choice
in the matter, is fain to make the best of them.</p>

<p>I don't think I have described our various
workers. There is, for instance, the short, drab-looking
type of woman who gives one the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
that she is capable only of practical things&mdash;a
model housewife and cook&mdash;but who, on further
acquaintance, affords some food for comment;
for, alas! her distrait little brain is eternally
going off at a tangent; she has neither method
nor common sense. If there is a tactless thing to
be said, she will say it. If there is a foolish thing
to be done, she will do it. To-day, to our horror,
one of these, for instance, turned to an old man
from Derbyshire&mdash;who was out to see a son dying
of spotted fever&mdash;just as he was taking his departure.</p>

<p>"By the way," she said, "if you find anyone
at home whose son is dying out here, <em>do</em> tell them
that it is such a pretty cemetery and so well cared
for...."</p>

<p>I need say no more.</p>

<p>At every inconvenient moment she tells one
anecdotes of her family history&mdash;how her
daughters have bought a white rabbit, how her
second husband committed suicide (we are not
surprised!), how a third cousin has been mentioned
in dispatches.</p>

<p>She alternately adopts a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de haut en bas</i> tone
towards the men and informs them that she is an
officer's widow and has never done any work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
before, or tries to claim kinship with the enlisted
navvy because he is John Smith and she has a
connection of the same name.</p>

<p>Is it to be wondered that there is sometimes
friction? We have had a trying time recently,
and have come to the conclusion that what one
does not learn of petty jealousy and feminine hate
out here is not worth learning! And the genus
"official enemy"&mdash;unknown, hitherto, to me&mdash;is
quite common. It consists of people who want
one's job, or one's friends, or anything else one
has; but, most of all, they want one out of the
country and out of the way.</p>

<p>To keep our judgment unbiased we have
conned Kipling's wonderful "If" and find some
measure of comfort in murmuring, as we fall
asleep:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>and blaming it on you&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, yet make</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>allowance for their doubting, too&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If you can wait&mdash;and not be tired by waiting or being lied</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>about, don't deal in lies&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Or being hated, don't give way to hating&mdash;and yet not look too</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>good nor talk too wise.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have had quite a number of minor worries,
too, which culminated this evening, when, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
last bucketful of coal, borrowed from a friendly
hospital, having been exhausted, it was found
impossible to obtain more than half a litre of
methylated spirits (with which we had hoped to
carry on our work by means of Primus stoves)
from anywhere. For the first time not only hot
dishes had to be abandoned, the pancakes and
fried fish which the men like so well, but even the
hot drinks, which we endeavoured to replace by
lukewarm lemonade made from the remnants of
our boiled water. Heaven alone knows from
where we shall get our coal to-morrow, for the
shortage seems to be getting worse. If only the
people at home would realise what it means out
here, and cease striking! When things had settled
down and the place was closed, I felt a blow of
fresh air was imperative, for the vitiated atmosphere
of the rooms is choking and we have no
time to walk by day.</p>

<p>As we slipped outside, Captain M&mdash;&mdash; passed.
"What on earth are you doing here?" he asked.
I replied that we had been breathing Woodbine
fumes for twelve solid hours, and had come out
to get some air.</p>

<p>"Take care not to be run in by the sentries,"
he said. "I will accompany you if I may, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
safety's sake." It is true we are bounded by
sentries north, south, east and west.</p>

<p>We walked briskly to the beach, where a full
moon lit up the sea, forming what looked like a
broad path straight up to heaven.</p>

<p>We were laughing over the tale of the
immortal Dr. Spooner who concluded one of his
sermons with the words: "And now, dear friends,
I must draw to a close, for I see I am already
addressing beery wenches!" when Captain M&mdash;&mdash;,
asking "May I smoke?" proceeded to light his
pipe, or <em>try</em> to do so, for each time he lit a match
the breeze put it out. Whilst he retired to light
it by the rocks someone quoted another Spoonerism&mdash;when
to a negligent student he said: "You
have hissed all my mystery lessons and tasted half
a worm!"</p>

<p>Laughing and all but forgetting our weariness,
we turned to go home.</p>

<p>In the distance we discerned figures coming
towards us&mdash;steadily and from all sides.</p>

<p>"Strange!" said someone. "The beach
seemed deserted enough when we came."</p>

<p>"Why, it's gendarmes!" I cried.</p>

<p>And sure enough it was, and they were
advancing, rifles cocked and loaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>They came straight up to us and halted four
paces away, just as we were debating whether to
run away or trust to luck that our escort could
protect us.</p>

<p>In a stentorian voice the leader exclaimed
accusingly: "You lit three matches."</p>

<p>No one denied it, and on Captain M&mdash;&mdash; parleying
with them, it transpired that under martial
law the beach and cliffs are entirely forbidden
precincts after sundown.</p>

<p>On discovering who we were they owned that
they had seriously debated the advisability of
shooting us from the cliffs, and would certainly
have done so had we turned tail and fled!</p>

<p>Insignificant though the incident is, it serves
to show how efficiently our Allies guard their
coast, how thorough and quick they are in their
methods, and how little they leave to chance, even
at a hospital base.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>April 22nd.</i> It has been impossible to write.
We have been working sixteen to eighteen, even
twenty, hours per day. The rush of troops that
preceded and succeeded the British success at
Hill 60 has broken up most of the camp workers,
so that we have taken to rising at 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, motoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to the camp in the car now devoted to the
"relatives," and turning our hands at other
people's jobs before it is time to begin our own.</p>

<p>Camp work is different from anything in the
world. The crowd is such that it is impossible
(with our limited number of workers and insufficient
equipment) to keep supplies equal to
demand.</p>

<p>After an hour spent in handing out field service
post cards (which is all the men may send home
from here) one is dizzy from the crowd. Twenty
thousand cards disappear in less time than it
takes to tell, although each man is in reality only
allowed one.</p>

<p>They will come up time after time pleading
for a second. "I've a wife <em>and</em> a mother," says
one; while the wilier will ask: "Can I have a
second for the company sergeant-major, who is
outside the tent?"</p>

<p>"What, the <em>same</em> company sergeant-major?"
I inquired, after the twentieth application of this
kind.</p>

<p>If you are cutting up loaves or buttering bread
you become breathless in your haste as the many
hungry eyes gaze eagerly at the food.</p>

<p>Many of the men have gone foodless since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
embarked, ten hours ago, and some, who have
eaten, have been so sea-sick as to be quite
collapsed. They are alternately full of anticipation
and trepidation about the Great Unknown,
and a quiet "It isn't nearly as bad as it was at
the beginning" sends many of them away more
reassured.</p>

<p>The turf inside the tent is an odd mixture of
slush where the rain beats in, and almost concrete
mud where the trampling is worst. It has been
found necessary to put up a barrier by the
"counter," which is made of empty packing-cases,
but often, where the crowd is greatest, it
literally gets rooted up.</p>

<p>It is hard to say which is the more impressive
sight: to arrive at dawn and watch the shivering
figures emerge from their tents, wrapped in those
fine new blankets of theirs, and cluster round our
quarters, held back by the stern arm of the
military policeman until six o'clock announces
that we are prepared&mdash;or nominally so&mdash;for the
rush; or to watch them march off at night.</p>

<p>On Sunday there was a service. The men
came running to the tents and called for their
favourite hymns. There were two oil lamps in
the centre, and someone secured a candle for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
counter. Never can I forget that scene&mdash;averted
eyes, tense set mouths, and rugged faces with the
tears rolling down. Men who had never prayed
before prayed then, for they had the Unknown
to face and they knew it. They lifted the tent
with their voices. Then, seeing I was the last
English girl many of them would ever set eyes
on, a number came up to shake hands and say
good-bye and "Thank you." Heaven knows
for what!</p>

<p>Then we watched them march off. The camp
gleamed white in the moonlight. A crescent
moon was over the silver sea, across which the
lights of England were plainly discernible.</p>

<p>By the flare of one great lamp they came up
out of the dark, and, company after company, like
a phantom army, passed into the night.</p>

<p>It seemed like a dream. The receding tramp,
tramp, tramp, the distant sound of drums, the
deserted tents. And only the lazy flap of the
canvas in the breeze remained to remind us of
those heroes who have gone up to "carry on"
the great game.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>April 24th, Sick Ward 21.</i> What a very
beautiful place hospital can be, viewed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
standpoint of a patient! What matter that legs
are too weak to walk or heads to think? What
matter that one's old vulcanite pen feels like cast
iron and runs on by itself?</p>

<p>Here are ministering angels who were once
mere nurses. Here are friends armed with many
good things, with irises and kingcups from the
fields and carnations from the south&mdash;and newspapers.
Yet, alas! the news is not good. In
spite of the Allied landing in Gallipoli that raises
our expectation of a speedy termination of things,
the situation on the Western front is bad. We
are now falling back, and the Germans have
started an effective offensive at Ypres. It is
dreadful to be able to do nothing but listen all
night long to the tramp of the newly arrived
troops, the sickening sound of the creeping
"stretcher cases," to listen and to pray that all
will be well.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>April 29th, Hardelot.</i> If one were asked to
award the palm for good work during the war,
one would not hesitate to say that it was due to
those whose energies are devoted to the sick
nurses.</p>

<p>There is none of the glory, none of the kudos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
none of the laurel-wreath interest that rewards
those working amongst the men.</p>

<p>Just the steady, dullish daily duties of caring
for and tending an ever-changing stream of weary
women! Yet what work can have more far-reaching
influence on the wounded and sick than the
fact that the nursing sisters are strong and fit to
cope with their strenuous work?</p>

<p>Here, in the far-away forest of Hardelot, in
the beautiful yet simple house lent by the Duke
of Argyll, that, with its distempered white walls,
old oak furniture and bright chintzes, seems a
veritable bit of England, the Red Cross have
opened a home where worn-out nurses may rest
and recuperate.</p>

<p>It is like an oasis in this arid land. Lying in
the woods on a bank of luscious pine-needles and
green moss, while the birds sing, it seems to
unaccustomed ears almost perfect; and the calm
pines lift their stately heads to the clear blue sky,
swaying rhythmically, contentedly, in the breeze.
It is intoxicating.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />

<small>May, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>May 2nd.</i> This morning we attended Church
Parade at the veterinary camp hard by. The
chaplain, who had brought out a recently formed
brass band, conducted the service in a large sand-pit
from which most of the horses had been
removed to the sides. A few tents were dotted
about, a few sick animals still rolled in the sand
as the men came on parade, whilst a narrow path
winding up to the dark pine woods above made
us feel for all the world like part of a Wild West
Buffalo Bill show.</p>

<p>How the French peasants stared, open-mouthed,
as the service proceeded, wondering at
our madness as we stood there in the sand-pit,
with a misty rain enveloping everything, singing
at the top of our voices. Many of the men recognised
nurses who had been at clearing stations, as
we wended our way amongst the sick and wounded
horses, the foals, the "prisoner" animals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
glanced at the well-equipped but insufficiently
stocked dispensary.</p>

<p>The now famous Pr&eacute; Catalan farm supplied us
with tea, and I could not help recalling how just
a year ago we had been lounging in a punt on the
Ranelagh lake listening to a band&mdash;under somewhat
different circumstances! No doubt, somewhere
at home, people are still punting on the
river, or enjoying a Sunday afternoon nap under
the trees, or, being energetically inclined, a round
of golf or game of tennis, in surroundings very
similar to these. Only as we wandered home
past the famous Hill 243, through woods blue with
hyacinths, fragrant with wild orchids, primroses,
kingcups, violets and every perfect flower one
could desire or dream of, and every perfect woodland
perfume one could experience, and every
perfect colour the eye could imagine, the sound
of guns booming heavily and not very far away
greeted us ominously.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>May 4th.</i> In an erstwhile hotel facing the sea
the Secunderabad General Hospital is situated.
Not only are the wards often overcrowded, but
rows and rows of beds in the spacious hall, neighbouring
villas and auxiliary tents help to cope with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the numbers. An all-pervading smell of "ghi,"
or melted butter, makes one think that Little
Black Sambo and all the tigers must have been
put in the melting-pot.</p>

<p>Odd black figures, with unfathomable eyes
and strange turbans, move about their business
stealthily, whilst in the little duty-room two kindly
theatre sisters dispense tea to any visitors who call
on an uneventful day between the fashionable
hours of four and five.</p>

<p>Such is Hardelot. For, apart from the
hospital, the Claims Commission, the one shop,
hotel and post office, every building is shut up and
barred.</p>

<p>A convoy of some fifty ambulances on the road
tells its own tale. Sauntering into the one and
only shop, I secured the last bottle of ink (which
proved to be red), and betaking myself to the
sand-dunes, set to work on my diary. Across
the vast, untrodden expanse of sand the sun cast
long shadows; little fishing boats, bathed in the
glow, glided slowly homewards.</p>

<p>Hardelot is said to be an inspiring place. Was
not the "Tale of Two Cities" penned here?
Was not many an historical drama enacted, verse
inspired, music created?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i185">

<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet France in war-time to anyone incapacitated
is wellnigh unbearable.</p>

<p>Again and again unpleasant scenes come up
(and when humour flags is life worth living?).
The subaltern so unnerved by the sight of his
batman (only slightly hit) who was drowned in
the mud, that he could do nothing but reiterate,
with staring eyes, "And, for all I know, he is
there still." Tales of healthy bits of land where,
if you ask your way to a certain reserve trench,
the direction will be: "First on the left, and past
the dead Frenchman on the ant-heap," half-humorous
reminiscences of trench-digging where
other things&mdash;no need to specify&mdash;besides caps
and boots are turned up, haunt one incessantly,
and Morpheus refuses to be wooed.</p>

<p>All day long one notes the veering wind with
beating heart, conscious that the prevailing west
wind is all-propitious to the German's latest invention
of the Devil, the poison-gas; conscious of
the long nights in which one has lain awake as the
sound of the receding sea was replaced by the
ghastly choking of the ward of gassed cases
opposite (a sound comparable only to a roomful
of panting dogs), or the cough of the man dying
with a bullet through his lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>May 14th.</i> At home there are strikes and
rumours of strikes, instigated, no doubt, by German
emissaries, but none the less shameful for
that; and one and all, as the men come down from
that "hell with the lid off," where, inch by
inch, the Germans are regaining that for which
so many lives were sacrificed, their cry is for
ammunition.</p>

<p>"We could have held our lines but for the lack
of ammunition of the <em>right kind</em>," they say&mdash;for it
seems that ordinary shells are useless when pitted
against high explosives and gas.</p>

<p>No one who has not heard that appeal direct
from dying lips (for dying men don't lie) can know
how great is the longing to tell about it at home&mdash;to
let the slackers know that for each shell not
forthcoming ten valuable lives are lost, ten homes
needlessly bereaved. It is intolerably unjust that
the man who refuses to do his duty out here
is promptly shot, whilst the man who strikes
at home is merely bribed with offers of higher
wages.</p>

<p>After all, it is a war not only of men, but of
arms and ammunition, and it lies in the hands of
those at home as much as those out here to see the
thing through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>


<p class="mt2"><i>May 16th.</i> At a certain canteen recently a
splendid, strapping fellow has been much in evidence.
A fine all-round sportsman of good breeding,
always ready to lend a hand where required,
he made himself beloved by men and canteen-workers
alike. In particular he endeared himself
to the man in charge of the canteen, to whom he
would talk of his wife and children and sports
prowess in days gone by.</p>

<p>Over his fighting experiences, however, a veil
was drawn; and seeing that even to hint a question
about it was to bring a look of unutterable terror,
of trench-haunted madness into his eyes, the subject
was left in abeyance.</p>

<p>Being neither wounded nor sick, nor attached
to the regiment at the base, it was usually assumed
that he was an officer's servant, which assumption
was corroborated by the amount of spare time on
his hands, for he seemed always at the canteen.</p>

<p>One day he came to the man in charge with the
request that he should find him some remunerative
work. Amazed, the civilian asked, "Why?
Aren't you drawing your pay?" Then the truth
leaked out. Months back, during an infantry
advance, in a fit of madness he had boarded a
passing ambulance and found himself at the base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
In plain words, he was a deserter. For weeks he
had lived, evading the canny A.P.M.'s minions
by the skin of his teeth, sleeping one night in a
barn, the next in a railway truck, the third on
the sands, and always feeding at the canteen. A
dozen times he had thought the game was up.
The strain was beginning to tell, and now that
he was down to his last sou there was nothing left
for it but to give himself up or cut and run.</p>

<p>Well, for the sake of the wife he was going
to risk it.</p>

<p>He did so. But the authorities who scrutinise
those little seemingly useless papers on the boat
were too sharp for him, and he passed for ever out
of the life of the only civilian who knew his story&mdash;to
be exact, out of the lives of all his friends.</p>

<p>And is not slackness at home all the more
reprehensible when one realises the penalties to
which men O.A.S. are liable? Is it to be
wondered at that we in France would gladly hear
the death-sentence passed on every one of those
traitor strikers?</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>May 17th.</i> Far, far out, the fisher-folk, their
hair and faces white with brine, are shrimping. So
far out is the tide that they are mere dark specks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
against the red glow. Farther along the coast a
number of A.V.C. officers from remount camps
are enjoying a chukker of polo on the firm sands.
The sound of heavy firing that had been so audible
during the afternoon in the Dover-Calais direction
has ceased. The friends who had come out to
visit the invalids have departed by the last tram,
on which a tall Sikh was busy teaching the French
conductor to talk English. The result may be
better pictured than described. When they set to
work to do a little bartering, ransacking each
other's pockets for souvenirs, exchanging two
pencils for a cigarette, a penny for a halfpenny, it
was interesting to note that the businesslike
Frenchman&mdash;the bargainer <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>&mdash;had
met his match at last.</p>

<p>And to-morrow a month's sick leave in
Blighty! Baths unlimited! Beef that is beef and
not horse! Lamb that is lamb and not goat!
Every fibre aches for civilisation.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>May 23rd, London.</i> No doubt the waitress
at the terminus was rather amused by the arrival
of three travel-stained creatures, one in mufti
and two in uniform, whose first demand was for
glasses of clear, cold water. But could she have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
known she would have been astonished to find that,
in spite of our bad crossing, our hunger, and the
subsequent good dishes she set before us, none of
us remembered <em>anything</em> half as good as this first
unboiled, unchlorinated, unsterilised draught.</p>

<p>It is impossible to blame anyone for failing
to take war seriously at home. Here, where
"business as usual" is the motto, it is literally
inconceivable that anything extraordinary is going
on in the world. No wonder that a certain
number of women were prating recently of the
forthcoming Peace Conference at The Hague.
Even those who are worst hit, who have lost their
nearest and dearest, are so engrossed in their little
charities, their bandage-making and knitting and
Red Cross lectures, that they have little leisure to
mope. London is as gay or gayer than ever, not
a bit purged, for every man home on leave is busy
making the best of time. How different from the
Frenchman, whose one idea on getting out of the
trenches is to set his house in order, to instruct
the women who are doing his work how to
manipulate the latest agricultural implements, to
help prepare for the harvest! Aldershot and its
vicinity, for all the many lives that have passed
out of it for ever, is the same. And here, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
big country houses one visits, people have still
leisure to indulge in nerve attacks at the sight
of their milliners' bills. Even the rise of that new
species, the very temporary gentleman officer, is
less remarkable at home. The only change one
notices (bar a few dances and cricket matches that
have been skipped, maybe out of respect for those
who will dance and play no more) is the Continental
atmosphere of the streets and theatres.</p>

<p>London is almost as Belgian as Boulogne is
anglicised. Rotund Belgians sit knitting in the
stalls, their sombre day dresses contrasting
strangely with our erstwhile brilliant audiences.</p>

<p>"Evening dress optional but unfashionable,"
as one theatre announces.</p>

<p>A joy for ever is the element of free-and-easy
good-humour brought over by our Colonials. If
the last ten months have done no other good, they
have at least knit together, in bonds that can never
be riven, our wonderful Empire.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />

<small>June, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>June 11th&mdash;Cumberland.</i> Speaking to a
gathering of village folk on work in France, I
invited debate. "If King George 'as got wot
Kaiser Bill wants, why don't they go and fight it
out themselves?" asked one man. "Wot difference
would it make to us if the country is ruled by
Germans or Englishmen?" said another, a lazy
fellow whose fields had remained fallow for years,
quite oblivious of the fact that under German
regime <em>he</em> would have been in the firing-line
months ago. The rest of the audience shivered
with the helpless indecision as to what their right
course should be: which shows the little faith felt
in the present Government, half hoping for, half
fearing the conscription of labour that seems
imminent.</p>

<p>That there should exist men who openly confess
that from their point of view the end of the
war will be disastrous is almost incredible. Yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
have come across a clergyman, working in a
Midland manufacturing centre, who has many
instances of this indifference to recount.</p>

<p>Is it not useless to hope that this war will be
the last? So long as men are actuated by motives
of commercial profit and agrarian gain, the dream
of Universal Peace must remain a chim&aelig;ra; and
the present upheaval, essential to the checking and
wiping out of Germany's abnormal line of development,
is destined to be only the first step towards
the Ideal of Progress which Europe (the Central
Powers included) had flattered herself to be
following.</p>

<p>Most astounding of all is the utter obliviousness
on the part of all at home to the seriousness of
the shell campaign, illustrated by the ridicule
hurled at those of us who uphold the Northcliffe
Press.</p>

<p>As I settled into the corner of the railway carriage,
after a delightful week-end with a dear
friend in Surrey, a batch of illustrated journals and
the <cite>Morning Post</cite> were pressed upon me.</p>

<p>No one can be a more devout devotee of the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> Court Circular than my humble self,
knowing full well that to miss that interesting
document means a gradual drifting without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
pale of one's many acquaintances. Nevertheless,
I asked meekly for "The <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, please!"</p>

<p>"That you, with your love of literature, should
read such stuff!" she groaned.</p>

<p>Then, confidently:</p>

<p>"My dear, at any other time I should have <em>cut
you dead</em> for such a thing."</p>

<p>There was no time to explain, as the train
steamed out, that I go to my newspaper for news
and not for literature.</p>

<p>Yet I could not refrain from marvelling at
the contumely showered on the only organ strong
enough to bring the truth before the public and
combat the weaknesses of a desultory Government.</p>

<p>The second astounding thing at home is the
fact that no one seems to realise the difference
between the Front and the Base.</p>

<p>Anywhere in France&mdash;Paris excepted&mdash;seems
to be "the Front," and no one who has not been
privileged to peep behind the scenes seems to
realise the gap that intervenes between the fighting
line and the back of the Front, as one might call
the Base.</p>

<p>And one is introduced to a strange medley of
people, all "going to the Front."</p>

<p>Not only veteran soldiers and raw recruits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
nurses, but charming women of leisure who
contemplate migrating with their retinue somewhere
abroad and earning fame "at a canteen
or anything that is wanted&mdash;just behind the
lines!"</p>

<p>Now, although I can claim to have worked
longer at our Base than any other British woman
(with one exception), to have withstood the inclemency
of its climate and its laws successfully for
eight consecutive months, and might therefore
pretend to be an authority as to where it really <em>is</em>,
not a single friend have I succeeded in convincing
that I am not a true heroine&mdash;risking my life daily
with shells bursting all around and the Huns a few
yards away. What they want are descriptions of
weeping gas victims and death-bed scenes (that
in reality are far better forgotten&mdash;if it is possible)
and incidents such as a youthful convalescent
sapper confided to me recently&mdash;of the man who,
though his head was blown clean off at midday,
was found to be convulsively clawing the earth
with fingers that seemed yet alive at sundown!</p>

<p>For such yarns there seems to be a great demand,
and if I told them that heroism at the Base
consisted of maintaining continual cheerfulness in
face of odds like bursting boilers which, for want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of men, cannot be repaired; if I hinted at the dullness
of buttering endless loaves, of wheedling
Primus stoves into working order, of changing
French money for English at a varying rate of
exchange, of living amongst a strange, heterogeneous
crowd of people, far away from one's own
friends, and stifling longings for one's <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lares et
penates</i>, of the dreadful monotony and various
other details of barmaiding, amateur and otherwise,
I should not be believed.</p>

<p>Therefore, with many a wiser, I seek shelter
behind a discreet silence, except when the insistence
of the "Do-tell-me-all-about-it! Have-you-seen-lots-of-horrors?"
girl elicits an ironical reply
to the effect that most of our time is spent in
champagne lunches and moonlight picnics.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>June 12th.</i> I must not omit to note the very
interesting meeting with Mr. Henry James&mdash;the
American author&mdash;who has so enthusiastically cast
in his lot with the Allies. It was at a tea at the
American Embassy. On being introduced, having
heard of our work in France, he made no secret of
his views.</p>

<p>"You young people are wonderful. You are
achieving what no other generation could ever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
will ever, achieve! After all, this is a young
people's war!"</p>

<p>I went home with a heart throbbing with pride
at belonging to a generation that, swept by the
great driving spirit (maybe something analogous
to Maeterlinck's "Spirit of the Hive") from little
ruts in life into the great vortex of war, has already
proved its metal.</p>

<p>Over and over again one is struck by the extraordinary
altruism that is displayed by those
taking part in what, after all, is but a tremendous
life-and-death struggle.</p>

<p>Everywhere <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> prevails amongst the
men. Take the private. Maybe he reared poultry
in some out-of-the-way farm in Somerset. Maybe
his pathetically wizened face tells of a childhood
in the slums. Whatever his life was before, he is
Private Tommy Atkins now, of the Blankshires&mdash;the
finest regiment, the finest company, the finest
platoon in the British Army; a V.C. regiment he
will announce with pride, as he sits down by the
dusty roadside to enjoy the ten minutes' halt in
what seems an interminable route march.</p>

<p>And the very Temporary Lieutenant whom
one knew only a year ago as the "knut," as, in
the newest check trousers <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&agrave; l'Am&eacute;ricain</i>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
lounged bemonocled in the Park, what of him?
Was he not correct&mdash;very correct and always correct,
as he patronised every function of the season&mdash;blas&eacute;,
bored and boring, always ready to criticise
every affair with an amusing cynicism?</p>

<p>He, too, chameleon-like, has taken on the tone
of his surroundings. Behold him in khaki, a born
leader of men! His boredom has become sangfroid,
his cynicism has blossomed into a brisk
humour that keeps the mess alive, his subservience
to the law of the "correct thing" has taught him
to face every undreamt-of tight corner with a nonchalance
wonderful to behold.</p>

<p>Yes, Henry James is right. "It is a Young
People's War." It may be an ironical fate that
designs the younger generation to lay down their
lives for the political blunders of the older&mdash;but
the true tragedy is not in the youths cut down in
the flower of their manhood, nor the girls broken
in health by the magnitude of the task they have
tackled; the true tragedy is in the derelict "dug-outs"
vainly hunting for jobs, the aged women
wringing their hands, with the cry, "We are too
old to help!"</p>

<p>And when our American friend, speaking of
his countrymen's work and schemes for ameliorating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the lot of starving Belgium, remarked that our
work will not have finished with the cessation of
hostilities, for then alone will the full pinch and
hardships of war be felt, the destitution shorn of
the gilding of excitement and uncertainty, I knew
he spoke truly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The end of the last month all eyes were focused
on Italy's rupture with Austria (we note that diplomatic
relations with Germany are not broken
off, no doubt for reasons commercial). To all
who have travelled much in that land of sunshine
it was apparent that, whichever way politics might
trend, public feeling (barring that section of the
proletariat under strong Papal influence) would
always be with the Allies; nor was it possible to
imagine any alliance between Italy and her
hereditary foe, the Hun, other than an alliance of
convenience. The Italian's contempt for Teuton
boorishness is as ineradicable as the Italian's confidence
in the brilliant future awaiting his own
kingdom.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>June 14th.</i> Two days later the Coalition Ministry,
which we pray fervently may remedy our
shortage of war materials, was formed. Now,
attention is turned towards the East, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Cameroons, the Dardanelles. Mr. Winston
Churchill has raised our hopes to the tiptop of
expectation with his mysterious promises of some
unparalleled and crushing success in Gallipoli. So
much so, that everyone speaks with confidence of
the termination of the war within a few months.</p>

<p>Yesterday some were only restrained from
hoisting flags by the desire to see the rumours
confirmed. Alas! on opening the morning papers
we were but greeted with the news of fresh Austrian
successes.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>June 20th.</i> With the receipt of "Marching
Orders" this morning, England and Home
seemed suddenly very dear. Like a dream they
come back, those places I have visited&mdash;the peaceful
Lakes; the cheerful Felixstowe hotel, where
one could revel in the soft, subdued lights and
pretty frocks; Bedford, which with all its khaki
seems to be playing at war more than any
other city, and where one or two people are
still extant who saw the Russians come through
from Archangel at the beginning of operations,
and even touched the snow on their caps! And
the different country houses, the different friends,
how little touched they seem by it all! True,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
in one or two once over-pretentious houses the
food is less lavish, the staff less numerous, the
clothes less exaggerated; which seemed a great
improvement.</p>

<p>Only I seem changed, and all the things we
once accepted as necessities of life are become
luxuries, from books and baths to the once despised
draught of clear cold water!</p>

<p>Yes, as to the sound of the soft-toned grand
we sat by the fire enjoying the ever sweet smell of
burning logs, whilst, with the inscrutable smile of
one to whom the mysteries of Life and Death are
revealed, the death mask of the woman who was
found in the Seine looked down from her oak
beam, and the hour-glass speeded its atoms along
the road to eternity, for the first time France and
work seemed anything but attractive.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>June 29th.</i> It is worth the journey to be
amongst our men again, to be welcomed as they
alone welcome one, with hearty handshakes and
hopes that one has "come back to stay."</p>

<p>Things have progressed a good deal, too, in our
small world. In the beginning, were one only rich
enough, or endowed with a title sufficiently illustrious
or notorious (it mattered not which), one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
might rent an hotel or a ch&acirc;teau, turn it into a
French or Belgian Red Cross Hospital, and resort
to a little harmless hospital work in France whenever
London became boring.</p>

<p>True, the authorities never encouraged these
little pleasure trips, but now that Boulogne has been
definitely declared within the War Zone, entrance
and egress are a very different matter, and it requires
quite an amount of strategy for anyone not
affiliated to some recognised society, and armed
to the teeth with permits, to get here at all.</p>

<p>There seems also to have been a systematic
"rounding up" of undesirables, and one by one
the so-called "officers," who, in the beginning,
had made the nights hideous with their champagne
suppers, have disappeared.</p>

<p>Naturally, we too have progressed.</p>

<p>In place of skeleton buildings, well-planned
camps lie along the shore, complete even to their
Imperial red letter-boxes. Once swampy convalescent
camps display smart flower gardens,
whilst Thomas Atkins moves about less molested
by demands for souvenirs, and somewhat solaced
for his enforced absence from home by the welcome
accorded to him by his Allies. If the
average man's vocabulary does not run much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
beyond the five phrases, "<cite>Bong jour!</cite>" "<cite>Compris?</cite>"
"<cite>No bon!</cite>" "<cite>Nar poo!</cite>" ("<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Je ne peux
pas!</i>") "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Promenade ce soir?</i>" the few exceptions
have made remarkable progress.</p>

<p>One wonders what the residents of Brighton
would say if a number of friendly French workmen
erected all along the Downs a miniature village
of asbestos and corrugated iron huts, interspersed
with tents and planted with trim little
gardens of bright flowers and evergreens; installed
pillar-boxes bearing French arms, their electric
power-station, their orderly-and mess-rooms, surrounded
the whole by a mass of barbed wire, and
having notified everywhere that this was Hospital
No. &mdash;&mdash;, to which there is "No Admittance,"
proceeded to explain smilingly to the bewildered
Brightonians that the huts are stable enough to
last for seven years.</p>

<p>If one could fathom the conflicting feelings of
Brighton under these conditions, one might have
some small understanding of the astonishment with
which our Allies, already hard stricken by war,
contemplate the problem of this little Britain in
France.</p>

<p>And there certainly <em>are</em> problems. Take, for
instance, the guarding of the roads. Naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
enough, even in the British War Zone the French
are loath to give up command of the road. One
cannot expect them to forget completely that
only one hundred years ago we were on a hostile
and not on a friendly mission! And so until
recently they guarded the barriers with fixed
bayonets. Alas! the valiant men whose zealous
watch was apt to prove irksome have now been
called up to the firing-line. We shall no longer be
tempted (those of us who are facetiously inclined)
to play pranks.</p>

<p>There was a certain art in producing, instead
of one's military pass, a card of membership of
some long-forgotten club or any legal-looking
document, providing it bore a portrait affixed, and,
brandishing it in the watchful guard's face with
a loud "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Laissez-passer militaire</i>," dash on to one's
destination. An old Hippodrome ticket has been
known to act as well. Ten chances to one, being
unable to read English, the guard would let one
through, and the delay would be amply repaid by
the good laugh.</p>

<p>But as I said, the many minor barriers have
disappeared, and there is no bluffing the men who
guard the entrance and egress to the town.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>June 30th.</i> Since the German introduction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
methods of warfare that would shame a savage&mdash;the
poison gas, the sinking of the <cite>Lusitania</cite>&mdash;the whole
attitude of our men towards the enemy has
changed, and one can safely predict that next
Christmas there will be no exchange of civilities
and cigarettes with the Huns as there was last.</p>

<p>Even at home the sluggards seem to be
rousing; and the "Frightfulness" whereby the
Germans hope to scare Britain into a compromise
is, on the contrary, acting as a much-needed tonic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One is struck out here by the psychology of
the youthful subalterns. The high anticipation of
"getting out," the silent horror of which they say
so little when they are brought face to face with
the "Real Thing," and which, once conquered,
leads to a resigned fatalism.</p>

<p>It's the same with all of them. "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Che sar&agrave;, sar&agrave;</i>,
and if we <em>are</em> to be hit, well, the sooner it's over the
better, only it would be nice to know if it's to be
an arm, or sight or&mdash;the other thing. No matter,
anyhow. We shall know it soon enough, and in
the meantime there is that long-delayed ninety-six
hours' leave in the future to dream of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aye, that leave that many of them will
never get!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />

<small>July, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>July 1st.</i> In place of the old hotel, where
operations are still being carried on, our new hut
has sprung up. The dimensions, let me see, are
somewhere about 120 feet by 40 feet. Beside
the platform at the far end lies the library, to fill
which our store of books is to be greatly enlarged.
Behind the counter are situated the ladies' room,
the store-room, the mess-room, to beautify which
I am busy all day making curtains, etc.</p>

<p>The kitchen is so small that it is not easy to
get range and sink and boilers fitted in, but a
patent coal-shed adjoining, by means of which one
may shovel coal straight from the shed on to the
fires through a lifting door, is a convenience. We
glory in a bath for the resident secretaries, and if
other sanitary accommodation is of the most primitive,
we console ourselves that, being under military
inspection, it is bound to be hygienic.</p>

<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF A HUT<br />
Behind the counter are situated the store-room and the mess-room</span>
</a></div>


<p>Our hut has the advantage of standing in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a><br />
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a><br />
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
own field, which, though none too even for cricket
pitches, should make an excellent football ground,
to popularise which we have decided to have a
formal opening ceremony, preceded by sports.</p>

<p>In the interim of getting things ready for the
hut I am lending a hand at an Expeditionary Force
canteen. The work, being in a camp where all
the men have been under fire, is intensely
interesting. But, of course, the social element is
lacking.</p>

<p>Apart from the amusements and distractions
offered, the men seem to appreciate the Y.M.C.A.
so much, because within the shelter of its walls they
can forget for the moment the stringent military
discipline under which they live.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>July 2nd.</i> In my hotel are quartered the latest
"Lena Ashwell Concert Party," whose good
humour keeps the whole place alive. The place is
so noisy that it is impossible to sleep. Said the
humorist of the party, "That reminds one of the
tale of the man in an hotel who was greatly disturbed
by someone walking about in the room
above. The second night things were no better;
the third, the place shook as if he were jumping
the house down. Going upstairs he tapped at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
door and said, 'I say, old fellow, do you mind
letting me get a little sleep? You've kept me
awake three nights with your noise.'</p>

<p>"'Am I disturbing you?' came the rejoinder.
'I'm so sorry. You see, I'm under doctor's
orders, and he's given me some medicine and told
me to take it two nights running and skip the
third!'"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>July 3rd.</i> It is no easy matter now to get a
photograph taken, even of so harmless a thing as
a grave. Nevertheless, in reply to a request from a
woman whose son is buried here, we resolved to
leave no stone unturned to obtain the necessary
permits. And, as we waited for the signing and
countersigning of the valuable documents at the
Commandant's office, whilst outside the "Caterpillars"
rumbled past, taking their heavy guns up
to the front, we wondered whether the same
stringent regulations apply to the many "neutral"
seamen, whose business, on cargo steamers, brings
them into the port.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>July 9th.</i> By the evening the usual septic
throat had claimed me victim, and in spite of
strenuous efforts to attribute it to imagination, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
is necessary to bow to the verdict that quarantines
one as a "Query Diphtheria" case.</p>

<p>Faced with the idea of being isolated in a
bathing-box ward and nursed by orderlies, there
is nothing left for it but to take the landladies'
advice and pray. Really, their faith is wonderful.
They pray for everything; and seeing old Madame
has a very short memory, and is always losing
things for which she proceeds to pray without
making the least effort to find them, St. Antony
must be getting rather tired of this house!</p>

<p>Blinding rain in a jerry-built summer villa is
not exactly cheerful, in spite of the Madonna lilies
with which it is possible to adorn one's attic.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>July 15th.</i> The finishing touches are being put
to the new building. My "Query Diphtheria"
throat proved to be a false alarm, and now, having
toiled for nine hours, behold me taking a moment's
rest on the veranda, whilst thirty men&mdash;voluntary
fatigue parties, who came in response to a hint
that their assistance would be appreciated&mdash;are at
work on different jobs.</p>

<p>Ten are darkening the table legs with permanganate
of potash. Some are cleaning windows
and others pasting on our "Dutch" frieze, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
a little Scotty, who has been lent us as an orderly
to help over these first days, and whose dialect
is so broad that even his own compatriots sometimes
fail to interpret, is watering and hanging
geraniums we have had out from England. Yes,
there is a breath of home about our hut. Bright
English pottery adorns the shelves, bright curtains
relieve the Mediterranean blue of the walls, and,
as I said before, our plants, straight from Covent
Garden, make the veranda as unwarlike as it is
possible to make it.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>July 16th.</i> Our hut certainly opened with
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i>! In spite of the fact that at midday the place
was still full of French painters and workmen,
we managed to be superficially in order by four
o'clock when the D.D.M.S. declared the building
open.</p>

<p>No sooner had the decorators laid down their
tools at midday for lunch than we bundled their
ladders and paints outside and set to work to get
the hall straight.</p>

<p>In spite of the rain and biting wind, our campaign
for opening with sports in the afternoon was
carried through; and after the many kindly
speeches and wishes for the welfare of the work, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
distributed the prizes from the platform, and we
concluded with a concert.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>July 18th.</i> And now we are all suffering from
a disease that might be called "Hut fever"; its
symptoms, a readiness to do anything to get the
place in order and (in spite of the still wet green
paint that leaves anyone who is careless enough
to lean against the doors a souvenir not easily
eradicated) to make it into the finest centre at the
Base.</p>

<p>The men themselves are equally enthusiastic,
and one of them, the local versifier, brought us a
poem penned for the occasion, which I quote as
it stands:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>There's poets come and poets go,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>You've heard of that no doubt,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But guess before you've heard much more</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>You'll want to throw me out.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But still, here goes; I'll really try</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And get outside the rut,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>By putting into time and rhyme</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>The tale of OUR NEW HUT.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>What sauce to call it 'ours' I hear</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>A few outsiders say.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But we don't mean we own the scheme</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>No, not a bit that way.</i><br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>We only mean its our new home</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>It's the best way to put</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Our thoughts about this new turn out</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>We've christened OUR NEW HUT.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Now if perchance in Wimereux</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>You're looking for a treat,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Step off the road to our abode</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And kindly take a seat.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>You'll find it filled with khaki boys,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>From ploughman to the knut.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But men of any mob, hob-nob</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Alright, in OUR NEW HUT.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I haven't got their names off pat;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>These ladies and the gents,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whose active work they never shirk,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>No matter what events.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But I feel sure we'll bless their help</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>When peaceful lives we strut,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And trust that in our lives, survives</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>The good from OUR NEW HUT.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus the American journalist who called on
us to-day won our hearts completely by designating
the hut as the "Grosvenor Square of
Boulogne."</p>

<p>The place is kept lively by the Canadians, who
are stationed close by, and who, with their music
and overseas songs that carry one straight out on to
the prairies of "God's Own Country," never leave
us a dull moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>Their ideas of justice, however, are rudimentary
and original. To-day the French girl whom, in
default of an orderly, we keep to do the rough
work, was in trouble. She is an odd little creature
of about twenty-six, eternally brandishing imaginary
knives at an imaginary husband who ill-treats
her. "The Little Savage" (thus we dubbed her
because of the way in which she holds her food in
her mouth and tears at it with both hands) had
put her beautiful two-year-old boy out to nurse
when she came to work, and, on returning to see
him, discovered that he had been kidnapped by her
parents-in-law.</p>

<p>After much ado with the police, and searching
and wrangling at relatives' houses, it transpired
that, owing to her own peccadilloes, the poor creature
could not claim the custody of her child.</p>

<p>Crying like a wild thing, brandishing her helpless
little fists, calling down invectives against the
laws whose aid, only a few hours previously, she
had been invoking, the girl returned; as I stood
there, trying to bring her to her senses with soothing
words and a cup of coffee, one of the Canadians
came up and listened, open-mouthed, to her story.</p>

<p>"Give me the child's address," he exclaimed,
his great solemn eyes fixed on the hysterical girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
"Law or no laws, it's hers. I'll steal it back for
her and brain that rotten husband when he comes
out of the trenches&mdash;and anyone else who gets in
the way!"</p>

<p>Although there are so many tales illustrative of
the Canadian lack of class distinction being told
on all sides, I cannot refrain from noting down
one told me by a Canadian to-day who fails utterly
to see the humour of it. A certain important
general came along to a Canadian camp to see
his friend who was in command.</p>

<p>"Well, and what do <em>you</em> want?" asked the
private on guard at the entrance.</p>

<p>"I want to see Colonel Birkdale," replied the
General.</p>

<p>The private raised his voice. "Say, Birkdale,"
he shouted, "come right here, there's a general
wants to see you!"</p>

<p>"What else could he do?" asked the narrator
of me. "He couldn't go off and fetch the old man
if he was on guard, could he?"</p>


<p><i>July 23rd.</i> In spite of the conquest of German
South-West Africa and the advance of four hundred
yards in Gallipoli, the situation seems as indefinite
as ever. Yet in the lull on the West is to be felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the presaging of the advance, in anticipation of
which we live on the tip-top of expectation. This
time there will be no shortage of ammunition, they
tell us; but, as Mr. Asquith says, we must "Wait
and see!" In the meantime we are less busy, and
able to enjoy exhilarating walks along the hospital-lined
shore; or inland, to where that ruined Jesuit
monastery that has sheltered so many Indians and
figured so often in the papers as the "Ruins of
Ypres," to rejoice the heart of an unsuspecting
public, rises an impressive pile against the sky.</p>

<p>Everywhere one notes the comparative opulence
of our men, drawing from 1s. 2d. to 6s. per
day, as compared with the French soldiers, who,
less well nurtured, only receive &frac12; d.!</p>

<p>And if the tremendous wastage that went on
during the early months has now ceased; if loaves
and meat are no longer buried in large quantities
daily, at least one could find quite a number of
poverty-stricken French families able to subsist
happily on the "leavings" of the camps hard by.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>July 29th.</i> I cannot help recalling how surprised
everyone looked at home if I spoke of
"Blighty," or a friend who was now a T.C.O.
(Train Conducting Officer), and another who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
been promoted to D.D.M.S. (Deputy Director
Medical Supplies). I believe they thought it
"swank," though they themselves had added
"strafing" and "hating" (in the European-war
sense) to their vocabulary.</p>

<p>Let us do ourselves justice! We at the Base
are so accustomed to our own "jargon" that it
comes as second nature to us.</p>

<p>We are often asked for "a cup of you and
me and a wad" (tea and bit of bread and butter),
or told that, although a man has spent all his
"toot" (money) on "pig's ear" (beer), he
would be glad of a pinch of "Lot's wife" (table
salt) to eat with a sandwich, as the "shakles"
(stew) was so undercooked as to be uneatable;
and I defy <em>anyone</em> not to lose reckoning of the
rights and wrongs of their own language when
every other man states his wants in a terminology
of his own. "Five steps to heaven" is, perhaps,
the favourite term for Woodbines; "Cape of
Good Hope" stands for soap; "jankers," confinement
to barracks.</p>

<p>And is not every third office blazoned with
hieroglyphics of some sort? Does not every third
man wear some kind of distinctive brassard with
its distinctive letters?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<small>August, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>August 3rd.</i> Two Canadian A.M.C. orderlies
were grousing that they hadn't left God's Own
Country to sit twiddling their thumbs in
Boulogne. "We volunteered for active service,"
says one. "Can't you picture it years hence,"
says the second. "Your children around you
asking, like the little boy in the picture, 'And
what did <em>you</em> do in the great war, Daddy?'
'Scrubbed floors, my son!'"</p>

<p>They did not grouse in vain. Two days later
they were drafted to Gallipoli, where no doubt
they will see all the active service their brave
young souls demand&mdash;and a good deal more, perhaps.
They must be magnificent fighters, these
Colonials, whose regime allows of their initiative
having full scope.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>August 12th.</i> Yesterday the mail boat came
in accompanied by two destroyers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Royalty is coming," clamoured the French.
"Royalty is expected," echoed the men. And,
having received an intimation three days back that
Royalty was expected, we awaited developments
in our best workaday frocks.</p>

<p>Presentation at their Majesties' Court is a
simple matter compared with the excitement of
receiving a Princess in France. I do not wish to
infer that the Princess was anything but her
charming Royal self!</p>

<p>It was the long retinue that preceded and
succeeded her, the curiosity of our French friends
as to <em>who</em> was coming (curiosity that we in the
know were not permitted to satisfy), the air of
breathless expectancy, that made the visit and
inspection a thing to be remembered. And in
due course, the usual formalities being over, the
presentations effected, our handiwork admired, we
were left with the King's cheering message to
rejoice the hearts of those of us who are already
beginning to feel so tired and war worn.</p>

<p>"His Majesty sent an especial message to you
workers in France, and desired me to tell you he
considers the fine work you are carrying on so
efficiently, of importance second only to that of the
men in the trenches."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>It was certainly a sufficient encouragement to
"carry on."</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>August 13th.</i> For a long time now we have
hankered after some words to express all the
heroism, the practical heroism, manifested around
us. And when some Good Samaritan at home
sent out a volume of Rupert Brooke's poems, it
may be imagined how we acclaimed him forerunner
of the poets who shall sing the greatest
tragedy of history.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously appeared the <cite>Times</cite>
supplement of war poems. For a year now we
have lived outside the charmed sphere of books,
and these documents came as a revelation of the
depths to which the cataclysm has moved our
singers. We had thought them dumb by reason
of its magnitude.</p>

<p>Kipling, we had been told, was "dead," so
far as his influence over the nation went; but <em>can</em>
the influence of the man who wrote "For all we
have and are" die whilst his nation endures?</p>

<p>It may not be great poetry, but it is great
patriotism.</p>

<p>And then there is the new school of poets who
have arisen&mdash;new to us, that is to say&mdash;and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
we are told may be heard reading their own poems
every week in London in the mystical precincts of
the poetry bookshops.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>August 17th.</i> We are working single-handed
now. That is to say, whilst one lady is on leave
a second is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors de combat</i> with a bad leg, and,
owing to the I.G.O. authorities' stringent regulations
by which free lances (if there are any
to be found) may not be pressed into service,
there are only two of us, which makes it hard
work.</p>

<p>And at home we hear of huts where the workers
are tumbling over each other for numbers!</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting figures in
this medley of men is a certain South African
veteran, a blind V.C., the value of whose work
amongst the wounded is immeasurable.</p>

<p>I last saw him being led down by a brother
officer to the supper-room after a diplomatic
Court at Buckingham Palace. <em>Then</em> all eyes were
turned on him in pity; <em>now</em> one realises that the
vast amount of good that this one man has been
able to achieve&mdash;cheering on fellow-sufferers not
yet accustomed to their affliction, showing men
how it is possible to build up a new though sightless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
life&mdash;must have made his own suffering worth
while.</p>

<p>The men worship him, and one word of good
cheer from him is worth more than the ministration
of a dozen clergymen.</p>

<p>On the whole the visits of the clergy are not
hailed with much enthusiasm, their arrival being
often looked upon as an omen of approaching
death at the Base, or, in the firing-line, of a big
advance.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>August 23rd.</i> A French orchestra was playing
yesterday afternoon, and on the cliffs that form
the lawns of No. &mdash;&mdash; Stationary Hospital were
gathered together to greet the Royal guest the
most fashionable crowd that the Base could produce.
The whole scene, but for the white tents
and blue-clad patients, might have been a smart
seaside parade, for the camp commands an
exquisite view of Boulogne, Wimereux and the
distant coast of home. Suddenly, with a boom,
a spurt of blackened debris, and a jet of water
house-high, a distant boat was seen slowly to
heel over and turn turtle.</p>

<p>Some attributed the cause to a floating mine,
others to an ill-judged practice gun; but as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
mail boat has neither come in nor gone out, as
everyone is full of the sinking of the <cite>Arabic</cite>, we
begin to believe the worst rumours&mdash;that a German
submarine has at last got through into the
Channel.</p>

<p>Later on, at an official dinner, the truth had
not yet been fathomed.</p>

<p>That dinner is, perhaps, worthy of note, as for
the first time we heard our Indian colleagues'
views on the European upheaval.</p>

<p>Having exhausted my conversational powers
with my dinner partner&mdash;a brawny Yorkshireman
in a violent check suit and correspondingly odd
accent, whose conversation for the most part consisted
in repeatedly and dolefully asking if I knew
what was the rate of exchange for the day (for the
edification of posterity, be it noted, it is 27 francs
50 centimes)&mdash;I turned my attention to the native
Christian Indian on my right. He was by no
means lacking in topics of interest, chief amongst
them being the effects of war upon India of the
future. He spoke with the assurance of a man of
education, being a barrister, and seemed to think
that the broadening effect of their sojourn in
Europe will be counteracted by the native adoption
of Western vices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting fact to note is the total
paralysation of all religious propagandist movements
amongst the Indians. The work of the
Y.M.C.A. amongst the natives at the moment is
entirely non-religious. The secretaries act as
interpreters, letter-writers, entertainers; they have
evolved a wonderful system for keeping the men
in touch with their kinsfolk&mdash;but any proselytising
is strictly barred by the Army.</p>

<p>Not by even so much as the use of Y.M.C.A.
notepaper&mdash;that might lead the natives at home
to suspect their warriors of being influenced&mdash;is
this verdict waived.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seems that the Indians have
come to look upon the Association as "both father
and mother," to use my informant's phrase, and
turn to it for assistance in most peculiar matters.
Said a Sikh to a local secretary to-day:</p>

<p>"Sahib, you go into town?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Sahib, I have one want."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Sahib, will you buy me two new teeth?"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>August 30th.</i> To counteract our little success
at Hooge there is the news of the fall of Warsaw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of Ivangorod, and Brest Litovsk; while in Gallipoli
a new landing at Suvla Bay and General Birdwood's
advance at Anzac brings us such a list of
casualties that we can only hope the venture is
worth the cost.</p>

<p>Where, I wonder, is the crushing success
Mr. Winston Churchill promised us, for which
people at home were preparing to hang out their
flags?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />

<small>September, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>September 3rd.</i> Time has passed so quickly
that it is hard to realise that beautiful autumn is
already upon us. Yet as the days draw in, lights
go on earlier, and our hut grows fuller and work
more engrossing. Outside the laughing, gurgling
wavelets, chasing each other round the rocks, are
replaced by white-crested breakers that rage along
the shore at high tide and cut us off from the
town.</p>

<p>Boulogne is once more animated, as people
transfer their attention during leisure hours from
country pursuits to the joys of the shops, whose
windows give forth an enticing glow.</p>

<p>Our hut being the most easily cleared and
converted into a concert hall, it was decided to
hold a performance there entirely for nursing
sisters.</p>

<p>About four hundred of them turned up, and,
in spite of the difficulties of getting sufficient cars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to convey them backwards and forwards, it proved
a great success.</p>

<p>The morning before we had spent in trying
vainly to get the place into hospital-like order, so
that even their critical eyes might have no fault
to find. It is extraordinary how many obstacles
stood in our way. For in France women scrubbers
never go on their knees to work, their method of
cleaning a floor being to flood it with water and
chloride of lime, and having vaguely played about
with mops on the end of a long broom, to leave it
severely alone; and as, long before the place has
had a chance to dry, it is being tramped on by men
in muddy boots, the results are disastrous, to say
the least of it.</p>

<p>Nor is it at all easy to get rid of the refuse of
the place, which has either to be consigned to the
incinerator, buried in trenches, or carted away;
and although the mayor's cart <em>sometimes</em> condescends
to call once a week, it usually takes a
good deal of persuasion.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>September 12th.</i> A day off duty is best begun
by a swim. To float on the warm, pellucid waves,
rejoicing in the sun and breeze, is to be alive. The
next item on the programme is to look up old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
friends. This is not altogether without disappointment,
for they are all, like oneself, "war
worn" and beginning to be pessimistic. Many
are on the verge of a nervous breakdown, owing
to the isolation of their position (it is quite a
tragedy in itself to note the number of people
who can't afford to have friends); others, and quite
a number, have found solace in religion and have
turned Catholic, being baptised in the Cathedral
that has watched so many changes these last
months.</p>

<p>From home come letters full of Zeppelin raids.
Squadrons of these must have come, according to
descriptions. Everyone claims to have had them
"just over our street."</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>September 20th.</i> We are glad to see the pest
of flies and wasps abating at last. May that
wonderfully efficient sanitary inspector&mdash;the bane
of so many people's lives!&mdash;whose unflagging zeal
has rendered this disease-ridden neighbourhood
quite a passable health resort be honoured and
sung as he deserves. The construction of baths
and laundries are minute details compared with
the difficulties of coping with drainage and flies.</p>

<p>Owing to the prevalence of the cesspool system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
here, the French authorities permit only of creolin
as disinfector; and, in spite of effluvia, none
of the ordinary deodorants is allowed. Then,
quite recently and with no warning, to cope with
the shortage of water, the contaminated water of
the Odre River was let in to supplement the
ordinary supply, and we were served with notices
to the effect that all water used (1) for drinking,
(2) for washing up cups, plates, cooking utensils,
etc., (3) for cleaning teeth, must be either boiled
or chlorinated, with many other regulations
calculated to counteract the idiosyncrasies of contaminated
water.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Revenons &agrave; nos moutons</i>&mdash;and our flies! For
was I not about to pen an anthem on all the fly
traps, papers, cemeteries and fly poisons that are
our daily consternation?</p>

<p>Each morning for months past every dish has
been covered by fresh muslin covers, whilst sandwiches
are stored under wire safes, and harmless-looking
but efficacious baits of creolin, hidden in
seemingly innocuous saucers of milk and sugar,
are set nightly, oblivious of the indignant buzzing
of their victims. Congested traps full of wasps
meet their fate in buckets of boiling water, whilst
those dangling fly-spangled creations, whose unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
habit it is to smite the unwary when least
expected, leaving an unwanted "souvenir" of
sticky, jam-like substance on his face or hair, are
consigned in all their odorous glory to the fire.</p>

<p>Oh yes! our sanitary inspector is as much a
tartar on the score of flies as he is on drainage
and the boiling of milk.</p>

<p>Only the other day, whilst inspecting the
kitchen of a neighbouring hospital, a typical
incident occurred. Grunting his approval of
everything, the Major was about to take his
departure when his eye lighted upon a solitary fly
which, having evaded all efforts at capture, was
crawling upon the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Adjutant!" roared the Major, "what's that
fly doing there?"</p>

<p>Completely taken aback, the Adjutant faltered
in trepidation: "I don't know, sir, to be sure.
But I'll ask the Sergeant-Major!"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>September 25th.</i> Now are all things explained&mdash;the
massed cavalry, the convoys, the ammunition
wagons we saw on a surreptitious journey we
made up the line; the "Something" in the air,
the expectation of the small and restless audience
at a concert we had this afternoon. For the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
"Push" has begun, and fifteen thousand wounded
are expected down here alone, and to cope with
the work every available nook and cranny has been
converted into hospital accommodation.</p>

<p>It was about 9.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, just as we were finishing
our evening repast, that there came a tap on
the shutters. There stood a polite but hurried
C.O. asking courteously for the <em>loan</em> of our building,
which he has every right to commandeer.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>September 26th.</i> A dreary "gun rain" has
set in, but nothing can damp the spirits of the
men&mdash;for rumour has it we have advanced five
miles along the whole line, with a magnificent
cavalry charge; and the 3,000 prisoners brought
down to-day clearly point to a crushing victory.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>September 29th.</i> A complete change has been
wrought, and as I sit in the library gazing across
the sea of beds where lie the weary bandaged
forms, towards the counter, upon which rise the
pile of surgical instruments and other paraphernalia
of sickness, the old smell, so familiar a year
ago, of blood-covered beings, whose clothes have
been time and again drenched through and dried
on them, comes to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="i235">
<img src="images/i235.jpg" width="600" height="363" alt="EXTEMPORISED HOSPITAL IN A HUT" />
<span class="caption">EXTEMPORISED HOSPITAL IN A HUT<br />
"Fifteen thousand wounded are expected down here alone, and to cope with the work every available nook and cranny has been

</a></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a><br />
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The place has been scoured out, and makes an
excellent ward, but for the elements, whose fierceness
baffles all efforts to heat the interior.</p>

<p>Apart from the wounded there is no denying
that Thomas Atkins has a strong penchant for
stuffy rooms. Maybe it is the reaction after
months of enforced outdoor life, but the fact
remains that if he <em>can</em> shut every door and window,
and huddle round a fireplace instead of enjoying
the fresh air, he will, without fail, continue to
do so.</p>

<p>Icy blasts penetrate the cracks of the unlined
wooden wall, rain pours through the ventilators&mdash;which
the French workmen had unthinkingly built
inwards&mdash;quite oblivious of the fact that the sleeping
figures on the beds are deserving of more
consideration. We have just put red lampshades
on to mellow the light, and even have dreams of
varnishing the floor one day, when things are
slack.</p>

<p>Outside, in the marquee devoted to the storage
of our tables and usual equipment, we are carrying
on our own work&mdash;at a disadvantage, to be
sure&mdash;but still carrying on, to facilitate which an
extemporary boiler has been erected near the
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>In the kitchen, where daily we are gleaning
undreamt-of wisdom on the scores of ration-drawing,
diet sheets, order forms, chaos would reign
but for the continual presence of one of us. For
the two French girls and two orderlies are tumbling
over each other in their anxiety to get things done
up to time. As it is, things work admirably, and
we are all growing adepts at brandishing heavy
meat choppers and cooking in the cauldrons and
stewpots, so large that no two women can move
them.</p>

<p>We stewed 30 kilos of meat, with vegetables,
this morning, and served it at 12.15. As we cut
up their meat for the handless and armless, they
were as unanimous in their appreciation of the food
as we had been in our admiration of the excellent
ration beef, of which each man is entitled to ten
ounces. We can only attribute the men's
grousing to the fact that it may sometimes be
insufficiently cooked. Better meat and vegetables
were surely never served before a king.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>September 30th.</i> As far as possible only the
slight cases are sent to us, so that the work amongst
the fit may go on as usual.</p>

<p>Amongst the lying-down cases is a man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
a bullet through the pelvis, a gaunt Irishman of
a strange hue, who, whilst wounded, had been
gassed by one of our own explosive shells.</p>

<p>"Look at them raindrops," said he. "That's
'ow the bullets fell, thick as that."</p>

<p>"The wonder ain't the number of casualties,
it's that anyone could live through it," rejoined
another.</p>

<p>"But we were through the fifth line o' their
trenches and fightin' in the open when I come
down," adds a third, his eyes gleaming with the
light of victory that betokens that it was all worth
while.</p>

<p>The achievement of our men seems all the
more wonderful when one hears how they were not
only outnumbered and outflanked, but, in many
parts of the line, lacking in ammunition, which
they maintain had to be held in reserve for the
main attack.</p>

<p>As the dressings were being done by the
solitary nurse and doctor in charge, as one by one
the wounds were attended to, and a silence pregnant
with unuttered groans reigned, one felt
vividly that none but Michelangelo himself could
depict that scene&mdash;those fine, muscular forms
looming in the dim morning light.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />

<small>October, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>October 3rd.</i> All the morning we had been
hard at work amongst our <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bless&eacute;s</i>. It is odd how
soon they endear themselves to everyone. There
is the little wizened bit of humanity who gazes all
day long into space with a horror-stricken look, or
falls asleep, half on the floor, half on the bed,
until aroused. The unearthly green pallor of his
face is not accounted for by his slum upbringing
alone, but by the German gas and the fact that
he has twice been blown heavenwards by exploding
mines. There is the finely built Canadian&mdash;one
of the first contingent who have all "seen hell
with the lid off," to use their own terminology&mdash;who,
when the pain of his rheumatic limbs allows,
is so very precise in his toilet. He changes his
shirt frequently, gloating over the neatly folded
bundles in which repose his requisites with the air
of a miser, never forgetting to clean his boots and
call for a glass by which to shave. He is "some"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
smart, and, judging by the crested seal and gold
watch-chain dangling from his waistcoat pocket,
must be a sahib at home. To us he is most remarkable
for his expression&mdash;the grimmest I have ever
seen.</p>

<p>Then there is the "buffoon" of the place, who
yarns lengthily about the four times he has been
hit (though his record only points to once), and
invariably sets out to sing comic songs when the
rest of the community is preparing to sleep.</p>

<p>The men are full of their glimpses of enemy
trenches and methods; of how they found quite a
number of Germans chained to their own machine-guns,
which reminds me of the most dramatic side
of warfare.</p>

<p>Very little is told of courts martial, very little
is known of courts martial, except to those whose
duties bring them in contact with the relentlessness
of discipline. To realise one must see.</p>

<p>Until quite recently a blue-eyed, fair-haired
boy lay in the end bed of an airy ward in B&mdash;&mdash;
Hospital. In spite of his extreme reticence he
won the affection of both nurses and patients.
His wound was healing quickly, but he only shook
his head when they spoke of getting home.</p>

<p>One day as dinner was being taken round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
he asked for a second helping of meat and
pudding.</p>

<p>"Why, whatever is the matter?" exclaimed
the kindly nurse. "Are you very hungry?"</p>

<p>"Not very, Sister; but it's my last dinner!"
came the quiet answer.</p>

<p>Not understanding, the Sister repeated the
remark to the Medical Officer.</p>

<p>It was quite true. The boy's wounds were
self-inflicted. It was a case for court martial.
Next day he was gone.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 10th.</i> It was in the midst of serving
out the dinners that two friends turned up on their
way home to England.</p>

<p>Hungry and travel-stained though they were,
we were too busy to do more than hurl a frying-pan
and eggs into their hands, with injunctions to
help themselves until the rush was over and we
could attend to them. How they admired our
ward and its now stained, polished floors, for
which we found a solution of brunswick black and
turpentine so efficacious! The afternoon being
slack, we hied into the town to pay a long promised
visit to a naval friend, and were entertained right
royally, enjoying to the full the childish pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of having to scale ungainly ladders from boat to
boat, and listening to the conversation between
our host and the ship's captain in a jargon edifying
but utterly incomprehensible to the mere
landlubber.</p>

<p>We wandered round the quay, along the roads
on which stand well-guarded, but by no means
hidden, 5-inch guns, their attendant "caterpillars,"
and, in the trains, loads of ammunition.
As we watched cranes lifting great weapons of
destruction off the boats the significance of this
war of cold steel against quivering human flesh
was borne upon us. We sauntered round, marvelling
at the wonderful method by which, in less than
a year, the British have created a whole small city
out of nothing.</p>

<p>Gangs of khaki-clad workmen dwell here,
utterly oblivious, no doubt, of the wonderful
sunsets and Turneresque light effects as they work
amidst the stores of rations destined daily for the
trenches, or the picric acid, petrol and other
explosives that lie by the sea.</p>

<p>My friends' enthusiastic anticipation of home
was infectious, and it needed much will-power to
withstand their pleadings to get leave too. And
as the boat that carried them home grew into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
faint speck on the horizon, involuntarily our
thoughts went with them, past the brightly
coloured villas, for all the world like the sugar-candy
edifices of fairy-tales, to the land where
nothing is changed. Yes! There are hours when
one would gladly relinquish the necessities of life
for a few of its luxuries. Chief and foremost of
these, needless to say, would be an unlimited
supply of those hot baths we were wont to accept
as our birthright, and are only just beginning to
value at their true worth. I wonder if anyone
who has not spent a bleak winter in the jerry-built
summer residences of a French watering-place,
whose eyes have not been continually offended by
the salmon-pink walls and hideous rococo cupids
on low ceilings, can realise the true joy of living
once more in a house, no matter how modest, but
a house built to withstand the weather?</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 13th.</i> The British advance on the
outskirts of Hulluch&mdash;the village of Loos, the progress
near Hooge, the French capture of that
ghastly Souchez cemetery, their valiant fighting in
Champagne, are things of the past. It is the
Hohenzollern Redoubt that is on everyone's lips
now, and Vermelles. Our own men&mdash;the hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
orderlies, that is to say&mdash;who spend all their
spare moments at the hut, are quite worn out by
this rush of work, which nevertheless seems to
have put new life into them.</p>

<p>Many grouse at the R.A.M.C. Few people
realise the deference due to those devoted men
who, day and night, are working to alleviate
suffering. They number amongst their ranks
many well-born men, who joined that corps at
the first call in the hopes of "getting out soon,"
and many who gave up excellent posts to enlist
are undergoing undreamt-of hardships with a
stoicism that is admirable.</p>

<p>After all, which lot is preferable? That of
the man who, after running risks in the trenches
for six days, finds himself in billets the succeeding
week, able to enjoy his liberty with the
consciousness of having earned it&mdash;or the man
who has had steadily to perform the same menial
jobs for fifteen unrelieved months, running no
risk, it is true, save that of infection, but subject
to the obloquy of those he is serving because he
has never been in the trenches? As an R.A.M.C.
orderly, who has made three unsuccessful attempts
to transfer into a combatant unit, remarked to-day,
the Base has well been described as "the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
where they keep you until you are so fed up that
the Front is a treat!"</p>

<p>A hundred temptations assail them, and men
who had never before felt the least inclination
towards drink find themselves drifting by degrees
into those enticing-looking little French caf&eacute;s not
yet closed by the authorities.</p>

<p>And it is to detract from the attractions of
these dens that we work to keep the men amused.</p>

<p>Said one onlooker to-day pityingly: "I hear
you have such a bad set of men&mdash;drunkards and
all sorts of undesirables!"</p>

<p>With truth I could rejoin: "Not nearly bad
enough. It's the worst we want, for they need
helping most."</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 19th.</i> There is no end to the gamut
of emotions one traverses during the space of an
ordinary day. To close one's eyes and look back
over the kaleidoscopic events of the week is almost
bewildering.</p>

<p>The picture of Second Lieutenant Jones, lately
junior clerk at Messrs. Morells, steamship owners,
being brought face to face with his former employer,
Sir Cuthbert Morell, private, A.S.C., is
inexpressibly funny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Private Morell accords the Tommy's salute to
his officer, who seems to have lost all his customary
swagger and starch for the moment.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jones stops. "I&mdash;I hope you're
getting on all right&mdash;sir," he stammers.</p>

<p>The grey-haired private, master of millions,
with shooting-boxes, country seats, town houses
that a prince might envy, replies to his &pound;100 per
annum clerk and superior officer that all is well.
For a moment they gaze at each other speechless.
Then the topsy-turvydom of it all grows
too much for them, and, to the astonishment of
the onlooker, the adjutant of Jones's regiment,
they burst into a roar of laughter that, contrary
to all military etiquette, ends in a hearty handshake.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 20th.</i> Whilst we were still a hospital,
and our work temporarily paralysed, a new hut
was opened. In a state of great indignation some
of the men clustered round to reassure us as to
their patriotism to the old place.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> needn't fear no rivalry," exclaimed
one; "they've got the wrong class o' person doon
there."</p>

<p>"This is <em>our</em> hut, and you make us feel as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
we belonged to the place and it to us," said
another.</p>

<p>If their loyalty warmed our hearts, it did not
in the least facilitate the task of explanation that
our Association fears no rivalry, that it is not
attempting to run a cheap caf&eacute;, and rather than
be thought to outbid anyone else would pack up
its traps and depart.</p>

<p>Such is the spirit of the institution for which
we are working. And perhaps I may whisper it
in my diary that in one place, when some unscrupulous
folk were bribing unwary men with
free drinks to spread abroad that the Association
tea was of an inferior quality to theirs, with their
truly magnanimous spirit the Y.M.C.A. <em>did</em> walk
out of the camp, and yet continued to supply the
said unscrupulous folk with all the stores they
required.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, we're all inordinately proud to be
working under the sign of the Red Triangle!</p>

<p>Many, no doubt, have used the institution for
the purpose of gratifying their curiosity, more as
a means of playing their r&ocirc;le in the Great Game,
and most, maybe, will sever their connection with
the Association to which they owe so much with
the cessation of hostilities; but those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
been vouchsafed an insight into the methods of
the Y.M.C.A., the dominating spirit that has
driven it into the position of responsibility it now
holds&mdash;in face of the derision with which its
rise was first greeted&mdash;will not forget that the
Y.M.C.A. has never yet failed where it was most
needed, never shown anything but the greatest
magnanimity of spirit. Entirely undenominational,
it throws its doors open to every sect under
the sun, its buildings have been lent to Jews and
Catholics, Mohammedans and others alike; and
just <em>because</em> of its broadness and the largeness of
its vision it is having an evangelising power
undreamt of by any religious inquisition of the
Middle Ages. There will be many, after this
war, who will be able to say:</p>

<p>"I grew religious because I saw what a
wonderful thing active religion can be"; and
though the members of this Association&mdash;which
has a way of giving the humbler born leaders of
men an opportunity of leading&mdash;may never hear
of all this, it will be inscribed to their favour on
the Day of Reckoning! And surely the very
silence of its workings is sufficient testimony of its
strength, as its growth is of its utility.</p>

<p>Does the world know, I wonder, how daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
improvised centres are springing up nearer and
nearer the Front, to the men's delight, until the
old familiar sign of the Red Triangle&mdash;not Bass's
Pale Ale, be it noted&mdash;but the Red Triangle,
that symbolises "Body, Mind and Spirit," is to
be found even in dug-outs?</p>

<p>Nor is the institution behindhand in Egypt or
the Near East or Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Only to-day we heard of a secretary (originally
here with the Indian force) who, on landing at
Gallipoli, was greeted by the C.O. with a
cheerful:</p>

<p>"And what are you looking for?"</p>

<p>"A place with no shells flying about, sir, to
start a Y.M. centre!"</p>

<p>"Why, that's what everyone on the Peninsula
is looking for!" exclaimed the Colonel. "If you
can find it, by all means keep it!"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 28th.</i> All things considered, the
resignation of the French Ministry is causing far
less comment here than such a move in England
would make, though in Paris we hear there is
quite an upheaval. Internal politics in France are
so entirely subservient to the international issues
at stake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>One would not want those at home to know all
there is to know of modern warfare&mdash;of the vast
pestilential graveyard that is Belgium&mdash;yet one
cannot help wishing that some of the vibrations of
these strenuous times could be more clearly felt
by them, that they would cease to see things as
they wish to see them, and realise that the worst
is yet to come&mdash;that we must brace ourselves to
face it.</p>

<p>Not only the spirits of the fallen heroes of our
little insignificant Western Front cry out to be
avenged, not only the scarce human prisoners,
dying in hundreds of cold and hunger in disease-ridden
concentration camps; the girl mothers of
Belgium, the murdered innocents, the crucified
Canadians; men burned by liquid fire, suffocated
by poison gas, parched men dying of thirst on the
arid plains of the East; but every forbear of our
gallant race warns us that the end is not yet, that
to safeguard the future of our children the nation
must turn its whole attention to the work in
hand.</p>

<p>How can we blame the slackers who, for want
of confidence, refused to throw in their lot with
what seems to them a wild-goose chase&mdash;until
fetched? We must blame the slothful system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
that allows one man to profit by another's
patriotism.</p>

<p>We must not lay the blame of any one failure
at the door of any one particular man, but attribute
it to the fault we are most often apt to exalt as a
virtue&mdash;as if by so doing we exonerated our mistakes&mdash;our
slack unpreparedness.</p>

<p>Surely, until we are animated by one great
unity of purpose, one great desire to sink personal
in national interests, even as our dead heroes have
done, there can be no end.</p>

<p>Surely if our Russian Allies could achieve in
one day what reformers had scarce hoped to see
effected in a hundred years, and by one fell swoop
convert herself into an abstemious country,
animated with but one desire&mdash;to conquer&mdash;we
should be able to attain a little more unity, a
little less slackness?</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>October 29th.</i> The news of the King's accident
whilst reviewing the troops is the one thing one
hears discussed on all sides. Exactly where he
will be taken seems as yet indefinite, but the
orderlies from the Officers' Hospital opposite are
fully convinced that <em>their</em> wards are being prepared
for his reception. The French seem almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />

<small>November, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>November 2nd, All Souls' Day!</i> The Bishop
of Arras held a service in the cemetery, a memorial
service for those <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morts pour la Patrie</i>.</p>

<p>The rain streamed down from the steel-grey
sky in Boulognese torrents as the mass surged
hither and thither amongst the crowded graves.</p>

<p>Those graves into which but a year ago we
watched the dead being heaped three deep, into
which we cast our meagre offering of violets with
a wish that those relatives at home might know
that at least two English souls were there to pray
for them lovingly at the end, are now old graves
and planted with neat little boxwood crosses.</p>

<p>Oh! city of little white crosses on that high
hill, what a history of pain and valour you stand
for!</p>

<p>The bishop came late. Some feared the
weather might deter him; others scoffed at the
idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"A bishop who has faced the fighting with his
people in the field, who has watched his whole
diocese gradually destroyed, will not fear the
rain!" they said.</p>

<p>Addressing a few words of thanks to the crowd
for being present, the bishop hastily robed. The
choir chanted. A new young widow beside me
began to sob. Scarce an eye in that vast concourse
of black and uniforms was dry.</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Requiescat in pace!</i>"</p>

<p>It seemed to me that no passed souls could be
so needful of that prayer as the restless, tortured
souls of the living mourning crowd.</p>

<p>An irresistible something drew me once more
towards the now deserted hospital on the quay.
It had <em>had</em> to be abandoned for reasons of hygiene.
For even after the rise of its now celebrated dental,
ocular and aural departments, even when the lavatories
and baths and X-ray apparatus had been
satisfactorily installed, its situation&mdash;low down by
the sluggish water&mdash;its lack of proper ventilation,
made it untenable, and within the space of a few
days it was transferred to healthier quarters facing
the sea and refreshed by sun and breezes, where
there was no fear of the low fever that continually
attacked the staff in that original charnel-house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Once more it is an evil-smelling empty barn. I
clapped my hands to my eyes to see if I was awake.
<em>Could</em> this ever have been the place we knew, the
harbour of so much pain! Oh, could those whitewashed
walls and dirty floors speak! No tales
of massacre could be more lurid than the remembrance
of the original British Expeditionary Force
who passed through and will not come again. In
spite of the dead stillness that reigned I could feel
the throbbing of the many souls who passed away.
Vividly, as if no intervening year had elapsed,
their faces rose up to greet me with cries for water
and release from pain, whilst eager blue-ticketed
crowds pressed forward as the arrival of a hospital
ship was announced.</p>

<p>A rat ran across the concrete, emphasising the
desolation of the scene. Out of the gloom of a
certain corner the spirit of a nameless prisoner
greeted me. With a last tetanus spasm&mdash;a writhe&mdash;a
death-rattle&mdash;the jaw relaxed like a gaping
fish, and a strange little sigh seemed to betoken
a released spirit.</p>

<p>The mortuary door was blacked over. Why
not removed? For what purpose could such a
place ever be used again? The theatres still stood&mdash;deprived
of their hardly accumulated equipment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
A sigh of wind came through a broken
pane. Was it imagination, or did it bear with it
faintly from afar the old oft-heard cry: "Christ
help us!"</p>

<p>Bah! It was but an evil nightmare. <em>They</em> are
all gone. I alone am left to tell the tale; and
generations to come will never know.</p>

<p>Outside things are not much changed. The
cobblestones, responsible for the premature demise
of such innumerable pairs of stout boots and
shoes, are as uneven as ever. The best part of
the road, however, has now been railed off for
the use of ambulances only, in order that the
wounded may be subjected to as little jolting as
possible. I recall how, after our first few days at
the Gare Maritime Hospital, one of the nurses
discovered an easier method of getting from our
billets to our work, and how the half-hour's walk
to the hospital was soon superseded by a ten-minutes'
row in one of the many ferryboats from
one side of the harbour to the other. Sometimes,
of course, it had been too rough. Once, indeed,
there was nearly a calamity when an old boatman,
rather more anxious for the welfare of his pocket
than the safety of his passengers, ventured out in
a storm so violent that the little boat was in danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of being swamped by the waves, and necessitated
the putting out of the lifeboat, or whatever is the
Boulognese equivalent. Even then the strong
current proved almost too much for the frail craft,
which was gradually drifting seawards. For several
days afterwards most of us risked extra weary feet
rather than face the elements at sea.</p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, we obtained a lift in an
ambulance or private car, for even to-day the laws
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">meum</i> and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tuum</i> are less rigorous here than at
home. It is no unusual occurrence for a driver
going along a desolate road with no passengers to
offer a lift to any solitary pedestrian he may find on
the road. He will not, needless to say, go out of
his way if duty forbids, but just drop his passenger
at the nearest point to the destination for which
he is bound. Nor, in a place where there are
hardly any public vehicles to be had, is one shy of
"asking for a lift," a proceeding which one can
hardly picture at home.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 18th.</i> Out of evil comes good, and
if ill-health has temporarily paralysed my activities,
it has at least given me time and opportunity to
see something of the environment of the place
that has been our home for so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one hospital base fringing the sea and
situated in the pine forests which once formed
one of the smartest little golfing centres of the
coast whither Fate took me. There can be no
harm in describing it, for already we are told a
most exact and minute description has appeared
in the German medical papers!</p>

<p>Almost a year ago we had visited it, seen the
magnificent wards of the &mdash;&mdash; Hospital that has
now been converted for the use of officers, and
visited a large French hospital.</p>

<p>It had been run almost entirely by untrained
voluntary Englishwomen with a modicum of
experience who apparently diagnosed their own
cases and treated them accordingly. Well I
recall the hall of dusky Zouaves gobbling up their
midday meal, or disposing of what victuals they
did not require on to the sanded floor, just as a
vision of English beauty, clad in the daintiest of
nursing creations, tripped out of a side ward, her
eyes aglow with excitement.</p>

<p>"I <em>know</em> he's got enteric," she exclaimed
cheerfully to our cicerone, pointing to her patient
and glancing at the Red Cross book in her hand.
"I <em>know</em> he's got enteric, and I shall treat him
for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Exactly how many patients that charming girl
managed to dispose of I haven't discovered, but,
as the Court Circular announced her marriage
shortly afterwards, we may assume that the Zouaves
proved enough. What the hospital lacked in operating
theatres in those days it made up for in "dressing-rooms,"
where doctors and nurses worked side
by side, and when aseptic conditions always, antiseptic
measures generally, were things unknown.
And now? Along the roadside lie huts with
accommodation for over twenty thousand patients,
with all the requisite medical staff, and within quite
a small area no fewer than four of our canteens
have replaced the small tent of other days, whilst
individual enterprises run by free lances, commonly
known by their nicknames of "Lady Angelina
Flapcabbage" and "Mrs. Always Huntem," still
flourish.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>November 19th.</i> Of the observation airships
that have passed daily over our field on their way
to prospect in the Channel, I have said but little;
yet they are a very interesting item of our daily
programme as they search for mines and torpedoes
on a still day, wirelessing their messages back to
the aerodrome some miles away.</p>

<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>It was my good fortune to visit the hangars
to-day.</p>

<p>As the car sped along in the waning light and
drew up before the wooden huts which form the
officers' and men's quarters, the great hangar,
painted in varied hues for all the world like a giant
toy tunnel, formed an impressive sight.</p>

<p>The officers of the R.N.A.S. have a way of
making their bunks as shiplike as possible, and the
neatness of the place, the well-arranged vases of
flowers, the well-made curtains, bore out the
nautical reputation for almost feminine "nattiness."</p>

<p>Without, one was challenged on all sides by
vigilant sentries who guarded entrance and egress
to the place, to say nothing of the upturned anti-aircraft
guns, whilst grey naval cars panted in and
out on their business.</p>

<p>The sea of mud and general dampness contributed
to the illusion that one was aboard, as two
men came up to ask for leave to "go ashore."</p>

<p>Perhaps the C.O. caught the look of inquiry in
my eye.</p>

<p>"Ashore," he explained, "is the town of
B&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>The little outlying villages, boasting scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
more than three shops amongst them, made the
nearest town a matter of some importance.</p>

<p>Within the hangar lay all the trappings and
trunks of those huge inflated monsters, whose
levers regulate such wonderfully diverse bombs of
destruction, and whose observer's seat might be a
smoking-room arm-chair for comfort. From a
corner, where lay the debris of derelict machines,
we were allowed to purloin a small piece of the
yellow fabric as a memento of our visit, whilst over
the tea-table&mdash;for the quality of which there were
many quite unneedful apologies&mdash;we came across
the air jargon, of which hitherto only "dope"
and "cold feet" had figured in our vocabulary.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />

<small>December, 1915</small></h2>


<p><i>December 2nd.</i> Each honours list brings us
greater surprises than the last, for it seems that a
man who runs a military grocer's shop at the Base
in perfect security is far more likely to reap a
reward than a man risking his life daily in all the
discomfort of the trenches!</p>

<p>We have been convulsed with laughter lately
by the antics of a little chauffeur, erstwhile jockey,
whose reckless driving has for some time been the
talk of the place. He has long evaded the arm
of the law, but the other night, very unwisely,
knocked down an important French Staff Officer
in the middle of a country road.</p>

<p>"'Op in, and I'll give yer a lift," said the
jockey in his most Cockney accent, with a jerk
of the thumb towards the car, as he handed the
French officer a two-franc piece to hold his tongue!</p>


<p><i>December 3rd.</i> The French people often come
to us with demands for contraband goods. "Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
we sell them just a <em>little</em> tea, as it is so expensive
in France? Or cigarettes&mdash;just a few packets of
Woodbines? Or some matches, as theirs, being a
Government monopoly, are both dearer and of an
inferior quality?"</p>

<p>All these little favours we have regretfully to
refuse, explaining that it would be a breach of faith
with the French Government, whose kindness permits
goods for the British Forces to come in untaxed
and under bond, but who would not for a
moment tolerate the abuse of this privilege.</p>

<p>But the R.A.M.C. have many opportunities
of rendering little services to the civilian war
sufferers.</p>

<p>The confidence in khaki felt by the French
population is extraordinary and highly complimentary.
If a child sprains an ankle or cuts his
hand he will go to the first man in khaki for help,
be he orderly or medical officer; and owing to the
scarcity of French doctors, medical etiquette is
waived for the time being, and our R.A.M.C.
does wonderfully good work amongst the poor.</p>

<p>To-day our maid&mdash;"the little savage"&mdash;dropped
a heavy window on her hand. It was
badly contused, but she was more frightened than
hurt, and cried unceasingly. Whilst I was donning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
a hat and coat to take her to the doctor she
disappeared, much to my astonishment.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she turned up, all smiles.</p>

<p>"I was afraid Mademoiselle might take me to
a French doctor," she said, brandishing a bottle
of lead lotion triumphantly, "so I went along to
the big hospital that smells so strongly of good
disinfectant!"</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 20th.</i> Our days are busy preparing
for our invitation Christmas tea, which, by the
way, is to be postponed until New Year's Day,
owing to the amount of festivities and work in the
hospitals; but our interest is focused on affairs in
Macedonia, the fall of Monastir, General Townshend's
retreat to Kut-el-Amara, Sir John French's
retirement from command in France, and, last of
all, the withdrawal from Anzac and Suvla Bay.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 26th.</i> On Christmas Day we were
occupied in decorating the building, whilst the
men, true to their long-anticipated licence (for to-day
restrictions are relaxed), grew very merry over
their dinners, supplemented by unlimited beer.
With what results, it were perhaps indiscreet to
mention! But hilarious visits from various groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
of the prospective artists at hospital concerts, clad
in their make-up of mufti and rakish top-hats, with
a gait far from steady, make us wonder how much
of the afternoon's programme will perforce have
to be omitted!</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>December 30th.</i> Our Sunday evening services
are more enthusiastically attended since we organised
a male voice choir, with our best pianist as
president, and an erstwhile Sheffield photographer,
who has sung at the musical festivals, as vice.
Quite a number of undreamt-of denominations are
drawn together by the bond of music.</p>

<p>One might almost classify music over here
under three heads&mdash;extemporary, local, and imported;
and it is not until one has stood in a
crowded hall, or seen the enthusiastic reception
accorded to every effort in that direction, that one
realises the large r&ocirc;le music plays in the existence
of the average Briton, usually accredited with lack
of artistic appreciation.</p>

<p>Some there are whose hunger for music is such
that, all untutored in the art of playing, they are
constrained to sit down to any tin kettle of a piano
in a vain attempt to pick out some well-loved melody
with one finger for hours at a time. At these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
moments the listeners are not altogether sorry that
half the notes have grown dumb from disuse and
dampness!</p>

<p>I wonder if there is anything in all billet,
trench or Base existence to equal an extemporary
concert? Whether the means at hand consist of
a penny whistle and comb, a number of lusty
voices, or the now almost obsolete Made-in-Germany
mouth-organ, it matters not.</p>

<p>Invariably a leader of men arises (usually a
pianist), and as invariably he shows a genius for
discovering local talent. Maybe he has heard a
pal engaged in trench-digging whistle an air from
the "Messiah," maybe a deep voice bellows a
few notes of "Till the Boys Come Home." As
sure as he is there, the leader will collect his
material for an impromptu "sing-song."</p>

<p>Then the fun begins. Private Jones, the silent,
is discovered to be the possessor of a magnificent
tenor voice, whilst Corporal Rawlinson, whose
buffoonery is the joy of his company, displays extraordinary
aptitude for comic songs and anecdotes,
or a newly joined recruit, hitherto dubbed
"Snowball" on account of his pallor, is discovered
to have been a professional clog-dancer in pre-war
days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>The leader realises that here is material for a
really good Christmas concert to which every C.O.
in the vicinity may be invited with impunity. "A
pantomime," someone suggests, and a pantomime
is evolved. Solos, duets, choruses, all original, are
worked up to a perfection that is incredible, and
the neighbourhood is invited to "the Christmas
Pantomime in Three Spasms," for which "carriages
and stretchers" are to be ordered at nine
o'clock.</p>

<p>At least, this is how the sergeant responsible
for our splendid Christmas pantomime tells me it
originated. Costumiers and wigmakers from home
"come up to the scratch," as the men have it, and
supply not only complete suits for Robinson
Crusoe, Man Friday, Dick Whittington, and Fair
Damsels, but make-ups for clowns and harlequins
and all the other paraphernalia of pantomime.</p>

<p>Topical allusions and catchwords are the joy of
the audience for many days to come, and in the
intervals of the performance Sergeant Topham,
as a coon, gives humorous anecdotes, and Sapper
Hall sings solos, of which the refrains as a chorus
are encored at least a dozen times.</p>

<p>It isn't very great music, but, as one who has
heard most of the great music in most of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
capitals, I should like to state that there is no
more impressive thing in the world than an old
barn or outhouse "somewhere in Flanders," filled
with men whose voices threaten to bring down
what remains of the roof for very lustiness. It
may be a hymn, it may be an old melody with
modern ribald words, it is the primitive method
primitive man employed in prim&aelig;val times, of self-expression.
And if Britons do not compose complicated
"'Ymns of 'Ate," they do at least put
into their "Tipperary" all the passion of love and
patriotism and determination that otherwise, from
sheer natural reserve, must remain unexpressed.</p>

<p>Of local talent there is much to say. Since the
time of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">troubadours</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv&egrave;res</i> the fame of
the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chansons</i> has spread abroad, nor has
the stress of war lessened our Allies' hold on the
greatest of arts. Even now it is not hard to get
together a number of musical souls to form a
miniature orchestra to enliven dreary days.</p>

<p>The appearance of the band is apt to surprise
one. The 'cellist, in private's uniform, has to be
back in barracks by nine, he informs one; the first
violin, a minute boy of twelve years old, with a
couple of half-smoked cigarettes tucked behind his
ears, casts his eyes longingly on whatever food is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
near. He is at a local school of music, and works
so hard that he has little or no time to eat, he
explains. The pianist is a bearded veteran whose
six sons are fighting. He was once the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef
d'orchestre</i> at the one and only first-rate hotel,
which is now full of wounded. An officer in the
reserve plays the viola; he was a barber by profession,
and picked up his music from an artist
sister. Strange and diverse characters, they are
all drawn together by the bonds of their art, and
once they begin to play with all the finesse, all the
charm and taste of their race, the incongruity of
their appearance is forgotten. Nor is it necessary
to say that the appreciation accorded by their
khakied Allies is of unparalleled enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I do not remember ever to have heard anything
more haunting than a "Marche des
Estropi&eacute;s," written by a wounded Frenchman
as he lay in hospital and inspired by the ceaseless
stream of lame and limping figures that hobbled
past his window. It was a true sample of local
talent that bordered on genius.</p>

<p>We had had a concert in a big wooden canteen
hut, and for two hours the Frenchmen had entertained
their Allies by a series of popular tunes.
They did not attempt to hide their contempt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the fact that rag-times were more favourably
received than chamber music, but they played
them with a right good will nevertheless.</p>

<p>Martial law decreed lights out at nine o'clock,
and at nine o'clock the men trooped out. Darkness
reigned. Outside the rain beat down drearily
on to the mud-bathed road, above which sound an
occasional booming of distant guns was audible.</p>

<p>Someone said:</p>

<p>"Can't we have some <em>music</em> now?"</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef d'orchestre</i> understood and smiled.</p>

<p>By the light of two candles the four musicians
began to play. Their repertoire was big&mdash;they did
not need to call upon Hun music; they played
"Manon" and the haunting Slav music, and
Italian things that breathed sunshine and joy, and
"Sappho."</p>

<p>For fear of the military police we blocked up
every crack of the windows. Then, sobbing above
the sound of the elements, rose the wail of the
"Marche des Estropi&eacute;s," till every corner of the
darkened hall seemed flooded with light, and the
soul of the most dead materialist was reborn.</p>

<p>"My son composed it," said the bearded old
man, who alternately conducted as first violin and
acted as pianist, simply, as the last long-drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
note died into the stillness. "And he is in the
trenches."</p>

<p>It was only afterwards, when they had gone
and the windows were unbarred and the incessant
patter of the rain made the desolation of it all more
awful than before, that we realised how we had
hungered for music, and blessed the local talent
that had lifted us for so short a time out of our
weary and narrow rut.</p>

<p>Of imported music, one can only state that if
it is to be imported from home, no matter what its
quality or quantity, it will be greeted uproariously.</p>

<p>Great and small are welcomed alike. From
the celebrated oratorio singers and rag-time kings
to the obscure little girl who offers her services
on the score of her promising soprano voice, no
one goes away disappointed with their reception.
We show no favouritism! The artists themselves
confess that the bad acoustic properties of the
ward hastily converted into a concert hall, the less
boisterous yet none the less hearty applause, the
small audience, necessitated by the beds and
stretchers, all are compensated for by the gleam of
happiness in the eyes of those blue-coated figures,
the whispered "It was heaven" from the boy with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
the bandaged hand, the hand clasp of the one-armed
man. They find their great reward as much
in the feeble applause of the wounded as in the
tumultuous ovation of the fighting men, or a hall
crammed full of white-capped nurses.</p>

<p>A notice announcing the advent of a concert
party from "Blighty" is one of the "thrills" of
Front and Base existence. Everyone flocks to hear
it, and the debt owed to the association whose
generosity has made it possible for every Base,
and a good many places "Further up the line"
than the Base, to enjoy regularly these Lena Ashwell
Concert Parties, which are one of the most
civilising elements of life out here, can never be
repaid.</p>

<p>To be kept in touch with the latest songs, the
latest train of thought from home; to see, after
months of the same war-worn faces and well-known
uniforms, daintily-clad artists whose every movement
bears a breath of home; to hear, after the
eternal reiteration of the local favourites' small
repertoire, new music, new voices, it borders on an
earthly Paradise.</p>

<p>And, of course, the artists cater for the tastes
of their different audiences, and never forget Mr.
Thomas Atkins's love of hearing his own voice.
Anything in which he can join rejoices his heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and a valse tune played by a mediocre 'cellist, to
which the men are asked to whistle, often receives
an ovation infinitely superior to that accorded to a
famous singer's rendering of old folk-songs, much
to the concert director's surprise.</p>

<p>But then the valse was one that brought
memories of home and twilight evenings spent with
loved ones over the piano, or maybe visions of some
irresponsible ball-room mood that our generation
will never know again, and though it wasn't Great
Music it went straight to the hearts of the hearers.</p>

<p>And so, no doubt, one day, when War no
longer holds us in its grip, we shall hearken spellbound
to the strain of some melody that our local
band of tin whistles and combs used to play, and
mayhap with the divine discontent of humanity,
we shall sigh softly for the good old days of France,
bully beef and tin whistles.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />

<small>January, 1916</small></h2>


<p><i>January 1st, 1916.</i> Each New Year's Day one
wonders afresh at the oddness of commencing the
year in January, cold January, when all the world
is engrossed in recovering from Christmas benevolence
and bracing itself to hustle through the days
with the minimum amount of cold, instead of
Nature's New Year in April. January, this month
of surprises, with its rain and sunshine, sleet and
mists, its promises of rest soon to be found, is
surely already a hoary old man with a life of
infinite experience behind him, a month for
achieving and not for beginning things.</p>

<p>At least, this is how we felt when the New
Year's festivities, over which we had taken such
trouble, commenced. Our tables, plentifully laid
out with fruits, bonbons and crackers, the gifts of
friends at home as well as those here, betokened
rather Christmas than New Year gaieties.</p>

<p>If our decorations of green garlands, mistletoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
holly and ribbons were more elegant than effective,
they were, at any rate, appreciated, judging by
our guests' criticism as they waited in a queue for
the doors to open.</p>

<p>Throughout the tea, which kept us well occupied
as, cans in hand, we filled and refilled cups,
a first-rate volunteer concert party kept the room
in roars of laughter.</p>

<p>Some A.S.C. officers (professionals in peace
time) were especially clever in patter songs, and
delight was unbounded when one of them, unrecognisable
in a motley selection of our garments and
a gorgeous wig, in which he impersonated a
"flapper," moved coyly among the audience and,
willing or unwilling, embraced all within his reach,
singing in a high falsetto, "You made me love
you."</p>

<p>For those unable to come to the early tea we
hastily prepared a second spread for eight o'clock,
during which time a local French orchestra played
popular selections.</p>

<p>Thus, with much festivity, by which we hoped
to make a slight break in the monotony of "this
Base existence," ended New Year's Day, 1916.
Successful though it was, to me at least there was
a certain tinge of sadness, for it is impossible any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
longer to conceal the fact that, owing to failing
health, my days of work are numbered.</p>

<p>To be "scrapped" like the Ford cars, to return
home a derelict, a Rip van Winkle, is no pleasing
prospect; but&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">che sar&agrave;, sar&agrave;</i>. We are all fatalists
now, like the men in the trenches.</p>

<p>Nor is the passing of so many familiar faces
altogether a pleasing thing to contemplate, whilst
the psychology of new arrivals leaves us marvelling.
Did <em>we</em> ever thrill at the sight of a crowded
camp, a convoy, or feel an odd sensation of
pride at the sight of the khaki-crammed rooms
in the early days of our apprenticeship? Were
we inspired to write long descriptions of "The
Front"&mdash;as they insist on calling the Base&mdash;and
of War?</p>

<p>Every now and then one feels tempted to say,
"War? What do <em>you</em> know of war?</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> seen men as they came down from
the Front during the first mad months, primitive,
demented, at their last gasp, ready to face death in
any form rather than the hellish uncertainty they
had just left? Have <em>you</em> heard the groans of the
wounded, seen arms rotting off and legs smashed
to pieces, and dressed black gaping holes in young
boys' sides? Have <em>you</em> seen faces blown beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
recognition&mdash;faces eyeless, noseless, jawless, and
heads that were only half heads?</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> stood by the dying and watched
them in their last agonies, writhing with tetanus,
and prayed God to give a speedy release from their
sufferings?</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> been round the cold, extemporised
wards and covered up countless restless forms on
their pallets, smelt the smell of the mud-caked
coats that were their pillows, soothed their coughs
with what there was left of tinned milk, hearkening
as they cried aloud in their sleep:</p>

<p>"'Great Lord Jesus, help us!'</p>

<p>"Men who had probably not prayed since their
childhood, men who had probably scoffed at the
idea of God&mdash;have <em>you</em> heard them live through
their battles again in their slumber or under
an&aelig;sthetics? 'Get at 'em, lads&mdash;now's your last
chance&mdash;give it 'em 'ot&mdash;ah! ah!'</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> removed clothes and boots from
helpless limbs caked on by seven weeks' mud and
overrun with vermin? Have <em>you</em> seen forever
nameless enemy corpses washed and carried out
to the mortuary, and, enemy though they were,
because of their youth, wished that you could tell
their mothers you had done your best?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you have seen this&mdash;which you never
can see, for this was 'In the beginning,' and now
the great System is prepared for every emergency&mdash;and
not before, will you know what modern
warfare means."</p>

<p>Yet it is all something one would not have
missed, although no sane person would face it a
second time; for, as an American said recently:
"Those who have not participated in this war will
be for ever lacking in something which is not to
be recaptured later."</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 5th.</i> Not only did a Taube honour us
with a visit to-day, but it actually deigned to drop
a bomb or two and succeeded in killing a few
women and children, though not a single man, just
outside one of our huts. After an exciting chase
it was brought down, we are told, off Calais;
though exactly the object of the visit no one can
imagine.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 15th.</i> In the evening the Gymkhana
finals and prize-giving took place. It is surprising
what an amount of sport can be found in an indoor
affair of this sort.</p>

<p>True, it needs someone with a strong personality
to organise, but such a personality is in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
midst at the moment in the person of the Rev.
Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;, denomination unknown, but humour
and strength of character undeniable. In spite of
the fact that he acts as Master of Ceremonies, clad
in a ludicrous medley of garments, khaki breeches,
brown fisherman's blouse, canvas slippers that convert
him into a true "Simplicitas," he is never for
a moment lacking in the dignity necessary to a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ma&icirc;tre de C&eacute;r&eacute;monies</i>.</p>

<p>The greatest zeal is shown in participation of
the different sports&mdash;the wheelbarrow race, the
cock fight, hat-trimming competition, potato race,
the spar pillow fight, for which an odd contrivance
of wood has been erected over a buffer of mattresses,
and other items of the varied programme.</p>

<p>Most fun was perhaps found in the shaving
race, in which the palm was awarded to the man
who shaved his victim most cleanly and quickly
with the handle of a teaspoon.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 24th, Dawn.</i> It was about eight
o'clock yesterday that the first alarm was given.
In the stillness of the serene night the church bell
began to toll; simultaneously the sound of whistles
rent the air. Thinking it must be the military
policemen on their nocturnal hunt for delinquents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
not yet in barracks, I put my head into a neighbouring
caf&eacute; to drop a suggestive word of warning
to two unwary sergeants lingering over their glasses
of beer. It was not the military policemen, however,
for from the distance a cry of "Fire!"
resounded, and with the incredible rapidity characteristic
of all rumours we learned that the Enteric
Hospital was ablaze.</p>

<p>Guided by the smell of smoke and the dishevelled
groups at the doorways, we found ourselves
in the midst of the confusion. From the
lower windows of the building a cloud of black
smoke issued. Men on ladders, hose in hand, had
smashed the windows&mdash;a fact which merely served
to add fury to the flames.</p>

<p>"Turn the water on!" they cried, and even
above the din of the gesticulating, gabbling crowd
came the cry, "Turn the water on!" The
Frenchman to whom the appeal was repeated
shrugged his shoulders. He did not quite understand.</p>

<p>There is no wind; it is a divine night, as
calm and clear as midsummer, with a bright moon
looking smilingly on. It can yet be saved, this
wonderful building, whence issue streams of khaki
figures readjusting the respirators they had donned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
in place of smoke helmets, bearing with what care
they can their precious burdens on beds and
stretchers.</p>

<p>A voice beside me said:</p>

<p>"Here, you, take <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>"<em>That</em>" proved to be a woman's form which
the speaker was carrying with the aid of a frail-looking
little V.A.D., who, from the way she held
the patient, had obviously never been in such a
position before. I gripped the man's hand, with
a "Don't strain; lie easy!" to the patient. We
got her into a neighbouring house, where already
two or three other bad cases are installed. Their
beds are tilted upwards, they are clad in their hospital
garments only.</p>

<p>"Ah! You're there, Hope," says our burden,
as we deposit her in a deep arm-chair, to the white-faced
boy whose bed occupies most of the small
room.</p>

<p>The coincidents of war are strange! It is
supposedly from this very patient that she has
contracted the disease.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he's an officer now," came a nurse's
reply. "Gazetted to-day. Did you know?"</p>

<p>They are very cosy and cheerful, and as yet
the noise without has not penetrated the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
We pass out again. The fire is getting under way
now; clouds of black smoke issue from the windows
of the first floor, and flames lick the upper balcony.</p>

<p>Still they cry for more water.</p>

<p>They have moved the patients from the beach
to the side streets now. They lie on the roadway,
already soaking in the water which, by reason of
the countless leakages in the hose, fails to arrive
anywhere near the scene of action.</p>

<p>In their eyes is a mute appeal, as a gust of wind
hurls a shower of sparks over their helpless forms.
Then a cloud of smoke hides them from our sight.</p>

<p>"Is anyone left in the building?" is the question
on everyone's lips. A reassuring murmur
goes round that no patients are left, and the firemen,
looking strangely grotesque in their respirators,
are now making efforts to save a few of the
valuable instruments and records. Some of them
are cut about the face by falling glass. From the
open doors smoke begins to issue, and cries of
"Gangway, there! Gangway!" The hot flames
fan one's cheeks. They come in spurts now.
Great fascinating spurts! One surmises which
window next, and feels a ridiculous sensation of
pride at being present, coupled with a longing to
do something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>The opportunity comes. Load after load one's
hands are filled with apparently valuable documents.
"Officers' Mess," shout the men who
place them there, as one moves off to find an
entrance to the building.</p>

<p>On returning the noise is greater than ever.
The rescued are being deposited anywhere&mdash;everywhere&mdash;wildly&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">p&ecirc;le-m&ecirc;le</i>.
Red blankets fall from
windows, papers flutter a moment, adding to the
general danger, and get trodden under foot in
the mud.</p>

<p>"The left wing is doomed. Can they save the
right?"</p>

<p>"Why don't they blow it up to safeguard the
adjoining houses?"</p>

<p>Fragments of conversation float from all sides.
Everyone has suggestions to make, but it seems
to be no one's business to carry them out.</p>

<p>One's thoughts fly to those patients on the
stretchers, and one wonders why this must be
added to all they have already endured. Many of
them will die of shock. It all seems so unnecessary.
And all this time, silently and with dignity, the
electric lights in the right wing of the great edifice
burn on.</p>

<p>What are those old stone walls feeling as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
invincible enemy creeps on? They who have seen
so much of the levity of peace time, so much of the
sorrow of war, have come to their end at last.
They meet their fate bravely, unflinchingly, with
the fortitude of the captain of an abandoned ship.</p>

<p>One thinks of all the comedies and tragedies
that have been enacted within these walls, the
laughing romances of summer days, the weary
suffering. One recalls the months of valuable
research work that have been carried on in the
improvised laboratories&mdash;discoveries to benefit
mankind&mdash;all may be irrevocably lost.</p>

<p>One thinks of all the things lying there&mdash;the
little personal things&mdash;the treasures that can never
be replaced&mdash;the lover's first gift, the parent's last
letter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The doomed building has been abandoned. The
moon gleams red through the veil of sparks and
smoke on to the crowd that has congregated on
the beach. Watching the Ypres-like eddies of
flame, one casts a thought at the surprise of the
arrivals on incoming troopships; one wonders if
folks at home, too, are watching the stupendous
beacon.</p>

<p>It is all a matter of time now, and the watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
is so full of suspense that the end is anxiously
awaited by all. A wind is springing up with the
oncoming sea, endangering the neighbouring
buildings, more especially the adjacent infectious
compound composed of carefully isolated bathing-boxes.</p>

<p>On the roof of each stands an orderly extinguishing
the sparks as they fall by means of
buckets of sand and water handed up by the crowd
below.</p>

<p>To the horror of fire is added the horror of risk
from infection, as the rudely awakened patients
are hurried from their involuntary isolation. As
the roaring flames draw nearer, ambulances reeking
of disinfectants hurry backwards and forwards with
their loads.</p>

<p>The flames run on; turning, twirling and twisting,
they play round the glowing beams and iron
girders, revelling in their might, licking their
chops, one might almost say, as the dull, uncanny
thuds of falling masonry bring terror to the hearts
of the onlookers.</p>

<p>Then a strange thing occurs. Of a sudden the
roof falls in with a crash, dome and eaves, and
against the sky stands the flaming skeleton of the
ruin. Simultaneously a great red cross glows for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
a space of time on the southern side. And,
although it is only a burning window frame, it
seems to us to symbolise the invincibility of
that great universal emblem of mercy&mdash;the Red
Cross.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>January 25th.</i> With the dawn we visit the
ruins. An uncanny stillness reigns as the waning
moon gleams through the charred framework.
Distorted bedsteads hang by a thread from skeleton
balconies, charred heaps of clothing and paper
litter the ground. Isolated beams and fragments
gleam, ghostlike, in the desolate upper stories,
shedding every few moments a thin shower of
sparks. A slight wind fans the one remaining
corner into a bright blaze. The thin stream of
water is still being played, by way of precaution,
upon the adjoining houses.</p>

<p>A French sentry, leaning wearily on his rifle,
guards the approach on one side, whilst on the
other a British Military Policeman has installed
himself upon an empty cask to make the best of his
long wait.</p>

<p>Through the cavernous window frames, from
gaping cavity to gaping cavity, heedless of the
floors that are no more, the wind passes like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
restless, moaning spirit. All the wonder, all the
excitement, all the glory of its glorious end has
passed. There remains only the smouldering
debris, the blackened, unbeauteous bricks, the
after-smell of burnt-out burning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later in the day many sightseers began to
appear, some even walking out from the town
before their day's work began to verify the
reports. For, needless to say, many were the
rumours about the fire which had reached them,
and they were with difficulty persuaded that&mdash;a
few cuts and scratches from broken glass excepted&mdash;there
had not been a single casualty.</p>

<p>In an existence so <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">choc-&agrave;-bloc</i> with meetings
and partings as ours, it is only a few of the better-known
faces that remain in our memory. Yet
there came into our hut this morning a man whom
we shall not easily forget! He came with a kindly-faced
N.C.O., who explained that they were "joy-riding."
It was, one surmised from his shyness,
the patient's first outing, for he seemed as yet unaccustomed
to his disfigurement, which was, to say
the least of it, appalling, and which, by means of
his large muffler and averted head, he made vain
efforts to conceal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Something in the appeal in the eyes of that
pallid, crooked face that may once have been
handsome, something of the pathos of that limping,
bent young figure, as he stood by the counter
declining the sergeant's persuasion to take something,
with a pathetic gurgle, only just comprehensible,
of, "I can't eat! You <em>know</em> I can't
eat," touched us all particularly.</p>

<p>And to think that this is but one of thousands
of cases for ever haunted by their own hideousness,
for ever dependent on others. Such things
as this it is that have wrought us to such a pitch
of indignation that the words are apt to escape
our lips, "God strafe Germany, the author of this
devastation!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />

<small>February, 1916</small></h2>


<p><i>February 3rd.</i> To-day we are debating as to
whether or not a genuine spy has been within our
grasp and wriggled out again. The sum of the
matter is this:</p>

<p>Boarding a crowded tram on its way into town,
we were fain to avoid the closeness of the over-crowded
interior by standing on the conductor's
more airy platform. The conductor himself, an
ill-grown little Belgian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">r&eacute;form&eacute;</i>, seemed pleased
enough of company, judging by the avidity with
which he poured forth his sorrows into our sympathetic
ears.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Antwerp he has had no word
from his young wife, nor has he been able to get a
line through to her to inform her that he is alive.
His terror lest she should wed again before his
return was pathetic.</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">H&eacute;las!</i>" he kept sighing. "Has not Belgium
suffered more than all countries put together?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>We did not rejoin, as we might well have done,
that valiant Belgium's losses can only be compared
with the sum of English lives expended in maintaining,
maybe for sentimental as much as
strategical reasons, that little hell round Ypres
that represents all that remains of King Albert's
country; for at about this moment a dark man in
some kind of police uniform joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>He, too, was Belgian, he explained, and in
charge of the refugees in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"The French hardly welcome us cordially,"
he said, "but I do my best to help the poor creatures
whom Fate leads this way."</p>

<p>The conversation drifted to the recent air raid
on London.</p>

<p>"I wonder they don't come here," said the
conductor.</p>

<p>"On dit qu'il y a trop d'espions!" I remarked
simply.</p>

<p>The dark man jumped, and, winking significantly,
whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>"One can't talk here. You are in it too?"</p>

<p>Utterly taken aback, I was dumb for a moment.
Had I by chance come upon one of the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
of that huge octopus-like system of enemy espionage?</p>

<p>Then, moved by some unaccountable impulse,
I nodded knowingly, and pointed out to sea.</p>

<p>"You know, then?" he asked, nodding in the
direction in which I pointed. "Oui! Apr&egrave;s la
guerre."</p>

<p>What could he mean? What was I expected
to know, to be participating in?</p>

<p>I shall never learn; for at that moment the
tram drew up, and with an unexpectedly hearty
handshake and hopes of meeting again soon, this
protector of the Belgians alighted and disappeared
into the crowd.</p>

<p>Who could he be? "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Apr&egrave;s la guerre</i>"&mdash;what
did it mean? I wonder.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>February 6th.</i> My diary draws to a close. To-day
we went for the last time to the little church
on the hill.</p>

<p>What a number of illusions have been dispelled
since that October morning in 1914 when we first
crept in late from the hospital, indoor uniform and
all, just as we had come off duty!</p>

<p>The place had been packed then with warriors
caked with the mud of Flanders. How their voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
had resounded! For in the hearts of all was the
cherished belief, "It is all too awful. It can't last
long."</p>

<p>"Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far
away." What a significance the familiar words
had taken on in the unfamiliar surroundings.</p>

<p>And to-day? For congregation a few tired
nurses, an odd officer or two, some civilians over
here visiting their wounded and dying.</p>

<p>A service devoid of the burning enthusiasm of
other days, a sermon that did not even mention
war, or spur us on to greater efforts, or vindicate
our cause, but dealing with obscure ritual and
spiritual difficulties not likely to waylay most of us.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly our illusions are past. We have
learnt our limitations as a nation; discovered the
inherent nobility of many whose capacities had
hitherto lacked opportunity, seen how war brings
out the best and the worst of every character,
and noted that at the bed-rock of all men lies
the primitive savage.</p>

<p>The respect we so generously accorded our
enemies in the beginning is replaced by a justifiable
contempt for their barbarities. A certain
allowance is made for soldiery fighting under the
influence of ration drugs, but when we read, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
we have to-day, of the death of three hundred
Serbians, forced by Germans and Bulgarians to
dig their own graves and then, having bound each
other's eyes, await a horrible massacre, we are no
longer justified in our tolerance.</p>

<p>We are up against a foe whose devilish
unscrupulousness is only equalled by scientific
cunning. And to combat his ingenuity, to rid
the world of his demoralising degeneracy, every
resource of the Empire must be brought into
play.</p>

<p>Not merely individual but national sacrifice is
needed. Conscription of labour and wealth and
land, governors whose only inducement to govern
is the joy of serving, a free Press and, above all,
a sane and scientific education to fit our children
to take the highest place among nations in the
tremendous commercial war of the future.</p>

<p>Gone are the days of blind optimism and hope;
gone the men who passed through and found a few
hours' solace within these grey walls; gone the
youth that made the impossible appear achievable.
The very stones seemed listless, the dim daylight,
filtering through high windows, weary.</p>

<p>An old Staff Colonel in front of me leant
against the grey pillar and wept like a child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Was he mourning one of those who passed
through earlier? Most of them have gone West
by now.</p>

<p>In the interim of the swelling organ rose the
cry of the wind in moans and sobs round the old
stones whose founder had passed away this very
morning.</p>

<p>Such was St. John's-on-the-Hill.</p>

<p>Mists lay all over the city and over the dashing
sea as we wended our way for a last visit to the
camps, where we lent a helping hand.</p>

<p>It is as wonderful as the never-extinguished
vestal fire, this work that has no ending&mdash;these
huts where no sooner is one batch of troops sent
on than another arrives, with time only for
occasional spasmodic cleanings.</p>

<p>A battalion of K.'s "contemptible little
Army" had arrived during the night. If, after
nineteen months' fighting, this is the specimen
of manhood England can produce&mdash;well knit,
in the prime of condition, the embodiment of
health and strength&mdash;all one can say is: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cave,
Germania!</i>"</p>

<p>And though to collect the ever-dwindling
supply of mugs (beginning with a thousand on
Monday, one may safely reckon to find but 800<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
by Saturday night! Where they walk to no
man knows&mdash;sometimes homewards, more often
trenchwards, one surmises), although to collect
the mugs it is a literal necessity to step over
figures that lie huddled against each other in a
sleep so deep, so log-like, that nothing disturbs
them, one is none the less impressed by their
magnificence.</p>

<p>The evolution of the camp canteen is a thing
to note. There is the wooden roof and flooring
in place of the close interior of a boardless,
draughty tent; there is an augmented staff, for
ever cooking and stewing, to cope with the work;
and stores are conveyed regularly to the place,
obviating the necessity for those spasmodic rushes
to fetch substitutes for bread when the supply of
everything gave out at the same moment.</p>

<p>To be sure, the difficulties of taking the till
remain the same, and the problem of changing an
English pound-note into French money at 26
francs 30 centimes&mdash;the last time we were here
the rate was 25 francs&mdash;subtracting the price of a
cup of tea, a packet of shag, a pencil and a shaving
stick, doling out all these articles with the exception
of the tea; immediately afterwards rendering
a French three francs into English coin, subtracting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
for a bar of chocolate and a hand mirror.
Continuing this process uninterruptedly and unceasingly
for an hour, during which time one is
assailed by a chorus of questions such as "What's
the price of a 'am sandwich, Miss?" "What
time does the leave boat go?" "What <em>mayn't</em>
we put in a letter home?" etc., <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad lib.</i>; all this
to the non-mathematician is bewildering in the
extreme.</p>

<p>At the old Queen Mary Hut, where my
apprenticeship had been served, the development
was even more amazing. A billiard-room, with
no fewer than four tables supplied by a benevolent
speculator, has been built, and a row of baths for
men on their way home, whilst the kitchens are
so finished that they might well be envied by any
efficient housewife.</p>

<p>But perhaps the culminating point is the
cinema hall that has been opened not far off&mdash;a
cinema hall to accommodate a goodly number,
and worthy of the Metropolis itself.</p>

<p>There was a last committee meeting too;
those committee meetings that were landmarks on
our calendar. They were a fortnightly institution,
and consisted of the lady superintendents of the
different centres, who met the camp leaders&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
male portion of the staff&mdash;every month. Their
purport was to discuss the affairs of state, business
difficulties, etc.</p>

<p>By one who was competent to judge they were
described as the "safety valve for ladies who <em>must</em>
grouse," and certainly there <em>was</em> a good deal of
talk about nothing. One lady would ask how
many swabs and dusters it was permissible to buy
for one hut&mdash;a question which might, or might not,
duly be recorded in the minutes. The next would
complain of her indolent orderlies. Important
questions in themselves, but not of great use to
those of us who found it possible to settle these
matters amongst ourselves!</p>

<p>The agony I had gone through during those
early committee meetings will be for ever remembered,
for, being the only unmarried woman under
forty in a community bent on filling all vacancies
with their personal friends, my position was not
enviable. But for a sense of humour it would have
been intolerable. Over and over again the question
of age would arise as I would sit in dumb
impotence whilst one inquisitor after another
voiced their views.</p>

<p>"Miss B&mdash;&mdash; would be excellent in charge of
X&mdash;&mdash; centre if she weren't so young. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
officially she is only thirty, and it would not
do."</p>

<p>"We don't approve of young women," said
another. "<em>There</em>, of course, is the exception,"
bowing to me.</p>

<p>Seeing I was many years younger than the
youngest worker, my feelings can better be
imagined than explained. My own experience is
that the best workers range from twenty-five to
forty, and over that age no woman should be
allowed in the war zone. There is no room in the
system of "scrap and discard" for those who are
easily fatigued; and women unaccustomed to
manual work, however enthusiastic they may be,
are unable to acclimatise themselves to it as they
get on in years.</p>

<p>For <em>endurance</em>, too, younger women are
needed. As a subaltern, invalided down with
nerves after seventeen months' fighting, said to
me recently:</p>

<p>"It's all a matter of time&mdash;the only difference
is, we younger ones can stand it longer."</p>

<p>The same holds good for women's work.
Spurts of energy followed by collapse are useless.
It is the power of steady endurance that is required,
and found most often in younger women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor is there any room for the caprices of the
dangerous age. The past generation was not
brought up with the public school <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
which characterises the modern girls, and which has
taught them to play for their side or institution,
and not for their own ends.</p>

<p>But to get back to the committee meeting, and
to do justice to its evolution, I must state that
after all these months, during which we have combated
for automatic rising as recognition of work
for the Reward of Service, it has adopted the
broader view that not personal acquaintances but
proved workers are most deserving of responsibility,
whether old or young.</p>


<p class="mt2"><i>February 10th.</i> My final impression of the
place was a beautiful one. An extemporary
concert, with many choruses, a packed house, an
enthusiastic, cheering audience. It is like a very
beautiful dream that we had dreamed true, this
place; and, now that it is sufficiently perfect, other
and fresher hands than ours must take it over&mdash;fresher,
but not more loving.</p>

<img src="images/i305.jpg" width="600" height="330" alt="THE CITY OF LITTLE WHITE CROSSES" />
<span class="caption">"THE CITY OF LITTLE WHITE CROSSES"</span>
</a></div>

<p>Here in this little out-of-the-way corner of the
globe, in a very insignificant work, we have buried
all our youth and most of our vitality. God! but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a><br />
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a><br />
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
it is hard to relinquish the reaping to others!
"To renounce without bitterness!"</p>

<p>A last glimpse of that City of Little White
Crosses, where, past pain, past suffering, in rows
of close formation&mdash;closer than they ever stood in
lifetime shoulder to shoulder&mdash;lie those who are
"for ever England."</p>

<p>Could they but see those dear shores of home
they had so longed for with their dying breath,
radiating their messages of pride and thankfulness
across the Channel, how proud they would be!</p>

<p>A military cemetery "Somewhere in France"
is a thing one does not forget. If, one day when
peace reigns, we are once more growing slothful
and negligent of the bigger issues of life, let us
pay a yearly pilgrimage to one of these shrines of
our honoured exiles.</p>

<p>True, the French gravediggers will no longer
be shovelling the sandy soil over the newest
comers, hiding the tier upon tier of plain deal
coffins or the number-plates that are the only
distinguishing marks; true, the unwonted odour of
Death will no longer haunt our nostrils; mayhap
we, too, shall be deaf to the sighing of the many
souls in the wind. Yet surely the warrior spirits
will arise and strengthen us, whispering: "Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
us not have died in vain. We laid down our lives
for the Old Country. For the love of God 'carry
on,' as we had hoped to do."</p>

<p>A last look at the faces of those friends
who for many months have formed my whole
world.</p>

<p>Then "Cheer up, you have done your bit,"
they cry as we step aboard. As if any man,
woman or child of Britain has done his bit until
this thing is over, until there is some semblance
of the crushing victory that shall lay our unscrupulous
enemy low!</p>

<p>Then on to the boat.</p>

<p>One parting gift that was pressed into my
hands on leaving will be treasured for all time.
It is John Oxenham's little volume "All's
Well," and to us out here it seems as if he has
been divinely inspired to bear the message of hope
to countless broken hearts.</p>

<p>Travelling on board a troopship is not exactly
the acme of comfort for a woman at the best of
times, and for anyone in bad health it is distinctly
unpleasant, for the decks are so crowded with
warriors that instinctively one makes one's way
towards the ladies' saloon, only to find, alas! that
it serves as the general sleeping compartment for
officers. No sooner is the first throb of the engine
felt than the water-tight doors are closed, and
one is continually running into insurmountable
walls.</p>

<p>If, after many efforts, one <em>does</em> attain the
ladies' saloon by means of a cicerone to guide one
across the masses of inert forms sprawled over the
decks, and down various dark passages and narrow
iron ladders, it is only to discover that the once
cosy saloon has become an excessively close compartment,
from which, rather than be drowned
like a rat in a trap if a torpedo comes along, it
were better to flee to the inclemency of the upper
decks.</p>

<p>As we boarded the boat at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, however,
on this bright February morning, everything
promised well. Already the lower decks were
crammed with life-belted Tommies. Life belts
are the order of the day now, and in many cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
there is life-saving practice as well, as a safeguard
against any emergency.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned "Blightywards" in
anticipation of home, and to check their impatience
the men began to sing. The volume
of the song swelled to such an extent that it
threatened to bring the upper decks down, for
the voices were those of men who had earned their
leave.</p>

<p>"We must be waiting for some Staff knut,"
said a subaltern in the crowd, gazing sadly at the
guarded gangway, off which no one might pass
once their papers had been scrutinised, towards
the buffet so temptingly near.</p>

<p>Fragments of conversation were borne in from
all sides; some of them savoured of pantomime,
others of the pathetic humour of harlequin.</p>

<p>A <em>very</em> temporary "gentleman" second lieutenant
leant against the rail twirling an imperceptible
moustache. Although he addressed his
remarks to a sergeant of the Artists' Rifles on his
way home to take up a commission, they were
obviously intended for the edification and squashification
of the whole audience.</p>

<p>"Will you&mdash;er&mdash;stick to the Service&mdash;er&mdash;apr&egrave;s
la guerre?" he inquired, flicking his muddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
boots with his swagger cane. One expected to
see him place a monocle in his eye and cap his
remarks with a "What&mdash;what?" in simulation of
the theatrical swell. The sergeant's reply was
inaudible, but he was obviously a sahib.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;expect to&mdash;if&mdash;er&mdash;the Service is
still possible. Now one has to hobnob with one's&mdash;er&mdash;tailor...."</p>

<p>If the onlooker were seized with a desire to
throttle the young jackanapes he stifled it with
the consoling thought that he, too, was doing his
bit, and might turn aside to note that the bronzed
Indian Staff Major at the entrance to the hatchway
was being addressed by his General.</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> isn't mine?" he asked, pointing to a
frailly packed paper parcel of awkward dimensions
held together by a frayed piece of string.</p>

<p>"No, sir. That's something Colonel M&mdash;&mdash;
got for his son in Paris&mdash;toys!" he added in an
awestruck whisper that sounded like a sigh.</p>

<p>The General turned on his heels, also with a
sigh, and an "I see!"</p>

<p>Perhaps they both thought of days when their
sons, too, were safe in the nursery.</p>

<p>I followed the crowd down to the saloon and
fed on what there was&mdash;coffee and ship's biscuit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Being only a civilian, and a wreck at that, I was
served with a gentle consideration that bordered
on contempt. Longingly my thoughts wandered
to the buffet on the Quai.</p>

<p>The sun and the tide rose higher and higher,
the gangway sloped upwards to the deck instead
of downwards as when we came aboard. I looked
at the well-ordered crowd and closed my eyes. In
an instant the Boulogne of eighteen months ago
came back to me, the Boulogne that knew War
and the horrors of War.</p>

<p>I saw before me the vast consignments of
goods that lay along the quayside, destined, one
realised helplessly, never to reach their owners.
Overcrowded, understaffed ambulance trains
steamed into the station&mdash;trains that once bore us
to the Sunny South&mdash;disgorging their sad burdens,
who lay on stretchers in the never-ceasing rain,
awaiting the arrival of hospital ships.</p>

<p>Many died in the rain in those days, until that
Medical Officer was inspired to haul them into
the disused sugar-shed clearing station. Where
once stood the mortuary is now the innocuous
Censor's office. In place of the cheerless barn,
whose walls could tell so many tales, a well-ordered
post office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned away, haunted by the cries of the
dead and dying I had seen. Not the most solid
edifices of masonry can obliterate the gruesome
realities of a vivid memory.</p>

<p>A cheer went forth from the lower deck as
two mine-sweepers, bearing a prize intended to
send us to our doom, swept majestically into the
harbour. The canteen workers, who had been
allowed aboard with food for the men, moved off,
the gangway was hauled in. Another troopship,
alongside ours, partially obstructed our final view
of the old town.</p>

<p>Convoys of ambulances stand, as they have
stood for nigh on two years, in front of the old
Red Cross Headquarters. Coal carts, their owners
crying their goods in the low, monotonous wail
peculiar to themselves, still ply along the roads,
side by side with cars of every description, from
Rolls-Royces to the "Rolls-Fords" (no one is
ashamed to be seen in a Ford in the war zone).
Uniforms of every kind, khaki and the grey,
red-tipped nurses, predominate.</p>

<p>Tinkling their bells, the trams wend their way
in and out of the town, driven mostly by decrepit
Belgian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">r&eacute;form&eacute;s</i> whose tales of sorrow and wonder
would fill volumes. Picturesque groups of saboted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
fisherwomen cluster round a skiff as the gleaming
fish are unloaded.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tiens!</i> We are off! The watertight compartments
are shut. The sun, already sinking low,
tints the pinnacles of the old church, lights up
the windows of the fishing village with fairy-like
colours. One last look at the masts that rise
out of the mists, the gleaming, winding river,
the camps, the tents, all that goes to make that
wonderful elusive thing "The Base" in the war
zone.</p>

<p>Gulls follow our course and swoop down in
vain search of a meal!</p>

<p>In my throat is a stifled sob. So <em>this</em> is the
end. Broken in body, I am to leave the work I
love, and with it youth and vitality&mdash;and this
whilst the fighting wages hardest in the West.</p>

<p>One last look at the sun-bathed shore, and
then the boats swing outwards on their davits and
hide it all from view.</p>

<h2><a name="EPILOGUE" id="EPILOGUE">EPILOGUE</a></h2>


<p>It is an odd coincidence that the last words of
this War Diary should be penned by candlelight
in a darkened northern town, to the sound of
bombs falling on an entirely defenceless city.
With the truly sporting instinct of Britons, everyone
has turned out to see what they may of the
"fuss" by which our humane foe hopes to
terrorise us. By the light of flares the great
marauding machines of destruction are seen to
hover apparently stationary. It is a fitting
moment to add a note of apology to this book, of
apology to those whose homes have been ravished
and who might, therefore, resent the reflection
that as yet our Island has not felt the full pinch
of war; of apology to those and of explanation.</p>

<p>For it is needless to say this diary was originally
kept for purely personal reasons, with no idea of
publication, but from the desire one day to make
good to those at home the silences enforced by a
rigorous censor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing, however, that the interest manifested
in our existence at the Base seems general enough
to warrant the appearance of these pages, and
seeing there is no one else to tell the tale, I send
my little volume into the world with the prayer
that it may give to those who would know, some
idea of Boulogne as she now is, that it may carry
one or two momentarily away from their own
sufferings.</p>

<p>To achieve this is all I ask.</p>

<p>If in some parts I have spoken too freely, I
crave forgiveness on the score that I have but
recounted things as we saw them at the time.
If, on the other hand, there are many omissions,
it must be noted that a War Diary published
during war time is of necessity much expurgated
to meet the demands of the censor. Nor would
it be in the interests of anyone to tell of chance
meetings with well-known men and women whose
r&ocirc;le in the Great Game has not yet been brought
to light.</p>

<p>And for any dates misplaced I must plead the
extenuating circumstances of a busy, restless life
that left little leisure for the keeping of a detailed
daily diary.</p>

<p>Of the many friends who are still carrying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the work out there I have spoken but little, not
because there is little to say, but because my
heart is too full of the great work they are doing,
and the memory of little kindnesses rendered to
a derelict in the midst of so much that is more
pressing. May they in their turn, if time renders
them "scrapped" and useless, find joy in the
remembrance of their work, and peace in the hope
of one day serving again.</p>
